In the beginning I  told you guys a story about two women, Toni and Maya, in reality these two  women were Toni Morrison and Maya  Angelou. Two women who greatly influenced  my life and left a legacy on this world. They left a legacy that will transcend generations, for people they've never met. Many of us don't think that we have this power, but we do. This is us. This is us. Within the genome lies access and privilege to predict and ensure our  futures. Millions and millions of  mutations just like what were found in the PCSK9 drug. Will we step into this power and out of our ignorance? Will we change the way we think about genetic testing to ensure our futures? I  really hope so. This might all seem like a whimsical dream that I had about the future, but together we can make this a reality. Because a future without us, is not a  future at all.",

In them days, they farm three months, then when the lay-by time come—’round the last of May, June—they go to piecing quilts. August, go back to the field. October and November, up into December—and then after Christmas and New Year over with—back to piecing and quilting. Piece by yourself; quilt together. When you go to quilt, you beat the cotton out on the floor, first thing, to get the dust out. Then sweep the floor—collect the cotton—spread the lining out and put the cotton back on the lining, beat it out, put the top on there, get your thread and needles and hook it in the quilting frame.",

Because, no matter how \\\"fictional\\\" the account of these writers, or how much it was a product of invention, the act of imagination is bound up with memory. You know, they straightened out the Mississippi River in places, to make room for houses and livable acreage. Occasionally the river floods these places. \\\"Floods\\\" is the word they use, but in fact it is not flooding; it is remembering. Remembering where it used to be. All water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it was. Writers are like that: remembering where we were, what valley we ran through, what the banks were like, the light that was there and the route back to our original place. It is emotional memory - what the nerves and the skin remember as well as how it appeared. And a rush of imagination is our \\\"flooding.\\",

Maybe what we must demand is not liberatory designs but just plain old liberation. Too retro, perhaps? And that is part of the issue — by adding “design” to our vision of social change we rebrand it, upgrading social change from “mere” liberation to something out of the box, “disrupting” the status quo. But why? As Vinsel queries, “would Design Thinking have helped Rosa Parks ‘design’ the Montgomery Bus Boycott?” It is not simply that design thinking wrongly claims newness, but in doing so it erases the insights and agency of those who are discounted because they are not designers, capitalizing on the demand for novelty across numerous fields of action and coaxing everyone who dons the cloak of design into being seen and heard through the dominant aesthetic of innovation.",

So for me, there's this really concrete way of, you know, all of the things that put us in a relationship of greater than or less than with other human beings is the ladder of hierarchy, and all the systems that reinforce and hold that experience of greater than, or less than all represent that ladder. And so in a Western industrialized, you know, imperialist, colonialist construct, the top of that ladder is white, able-bodied, cis, heterosexual, masculinity. It's the top of the ladder and consequently somewhere at the bottom of the ladder is Blackness. And then there's all these ways in which folks are scurrying up and down the ladder. That ladder is also, you know, am I able bodied? Is that ladder also, you know, am I thin versus fat? Am I young versus old? You know, am I straight? All of the other, what we call in The Body is Not An Apology, \"default bodies\", bodies that, that we use to stand in for human. When I say, \"Oh, a human\", we have an imagination about what that human's body looks like. All the things that are the default imagination of the human body are the default system, they're the rungs on that ladder. And so the most powerful way to destroy the ladder is to destroy the ladder inside yourself. Is to look at the ways in which you, we, have embodied the tenants of this ladder. How do I engage in a relationship of comparison throughout my life?",

      "content": "We have to recover the capacity to feel.  And to name, necessarily, that which prevents and controls feeling. \n\nFeelings run the world. Feelings decide things, call us into action, decide reality. Feelings are also where we are most malleable and vulnerable - so much is unconscious about them and so embedded are they in our bodies. Our feelings are manipulated daily/hourly.  We become reactions, anxious, agitated, impulsive, overwhelmed and generally out of tune with our rhythm and the rhythms of life around us. \n\nOur own feelings, the ones that originate in us, and can be understood by us are drowned out by the overlay, the racket of distractions that sit on top of who we are. We have to feel. We have to feel what is the deepest for us, the flowering of feeling, what is not yet known. We have to feel and come to know the organic process of feeling. Through doing that we can come to understand ourselves, the world, our time, this moment, in a way that is truthful and congruent to us/our bodies. \n\nI honestly don’t always remember ‘what it means to be free’ or what ‘we’ mean when ‘we’ say it, but as far as I can tell it has a lot to do with feeling. To feel what has happened without punishment, to feel for each other, to not be made to feel what others can’t bear to feel, to feel proportionally and together, to have the time, space, resource to feel the exquisiteness of this life, to be felt as real, to be safe enough to feel vulnerability, grief, love. \n\nPractice feeling, make a place for it. Start small if you need to, feel texture on your skin. Feel another’s hands on your back, feel some disappointment or sadness or satisfaction - whatever you avoid, feel a smile in your belly, feel desire. Feel. You are waiting to be known and the world is waiting to be felt.",

      "content": "I think that people who are activists are folks who are taking action on particular issues that really move them in some specific way, but activism only demands that you personally take on the issue. That means signing petitions. Being on a board of a particular organization that’s doing good in the world. That way, activist is super broad, and that’s why people call people activists. Your individual action, for example, of writing, can be a form of activism in the sense that it wants to educate people and get them to take action in their own way. You are in that way potentially being activist in your orientation, at least, if not in identity. Organizers, however, can’t exist solo. Because who the hell are you organizing? You can’t just decide to wake up one morning and be like, “I’m just going to do this shit.” If you’re organizing, other people are counting on you, but more importantly, your actions are accountable to somebody else. Organizing is both science and art. It is thinking through a vision, a strategy, and then figuring out who your targets are, always being concerned about power, always being concerned about how you’re going to actually build power in order to be able to push your issues, in order to be able to get the target to actually move in the way that you want to. I have been an organizer for a big part of my life in the sense that I’ve been involved with other people in campaigns to move various things. But sometimes I’m just an activist. But [in that case] I have no accountability to anybody, and that’s kind of dangerous. Because there are a lot of people doing a lot of shit that nobody can call them on.",

      "content": "Absolutely. The entire food system is built on the theft of land and genocide of indigenous people. It is built on the trillions of dollars of unpaid wages to Black folks who didn't just do the labor but actually built the technologies and techniques that we use in farming. It was the Wolof and Mende people who were rice farmers who were stolen to build the rice industry of the Carolinas, which people are still profiting off of. The sixteen-to-one wealth gap—which means that a white child born in America today is sixteen times wealthier than a black child when they take their first breath—is not because that white child did calisthenics in the womb. It's because of inherited property—and inherited property from a legacy of discrimination. That includes everything from redlining to the Homestead Act, which involved literally lynching and burning people off their lands—16 million acres of land lost from Black farmers from 1910 to present. And so the food system is inexorably connected to the oppression of Black and Brown people. Even today, 85% of the actual labor done on farms is done by Spanish-speaking people with brown skin, right? The food system would collapse without that labor, which is mostly sub-minimum wage, with no right to bargain, no child labor protections, no sick days, no health insurance—the list goes on. And so how can you get a whole bunch of people together to talk about farming and food and ignore the racial priorities? Farming—meaning being a farm owner or farm manager, the way the USDA counts it—is one of the whitest professions in the United States. And being a farm worker is the brownest profession in the United States. And that’s not some accident of history.",

      "content": "Worker co-ops are ending structural extraction of wealth by anchoring money and resources in low-income communities. Worker co-ops are a great strategy for low-income workers to plug into economic opportunities. Workers are gaining access to owning business, not just waiting for a paycheck from one. Those wages feed into community needs and resilience, from educational opportunities and child care for kids or elderly care for older people, to remittances abroad and financial literacy for people who might not have access to those skills. Worker co-ops are also a great option for undocumented workers to legally work in the US, which nationals of any country can do if you are a part or full owner in a business in the US (a loophole created for wealthy men from overseas to show up in the US and mettle in their American investments). Generally speaking, there is a growing sense among progressive efforts for community economic development that co-ops, and particularly worker co-ops, are among the best strategies for building community wealth, creating meaningful and sustainable work, as well as building resiliency at the neighborhood level. Beyond this, co-ops also build up a stronger civic community. When your workplace involves democracy in the day-to-day over resources and decisions that matter, you bring that with you into other aspects of your life. When we zoom out and envision a future with real democracy in communities and our society at large, we start to see how the practice we get from workplace democracy is crucial to a thriving democratic society.",

Black Feminist Ecological Thought is not a reactionary response to the Eurocentric failings of mainstream ecocriticism. Black Feminist Ecological Thought illuminates and documents the ways that 1) Black women thinkers have always developed their own alternative understandings of the interconnectedness of all things and 2) these ecological understandings have centered the health, well-being, and sustainability of Black, African-descended women across the Diaspora since time immemorial. Black Feminist Ecological Thought asks all of us to keep our eyes peeled for the very subtle ways that environmental harm and discourses around environmental harm tend to blame, neglect, or obscure Black women’s complex relationships to themselves, their families, and their environments. But Black Feminist ecological Thought has always been whispering to us—urging us to understand the interconnected points of our unwell society as a first step toward restoring our environments. The aim of Black Feminist Ecological Thought is to open more portals for us to thoughtfully confront all the melancholy and promise of ecological healing, or as Zora Hurston Neale might say, to confront all the “dawn and doom” in the branches.",

Of course it was important to reflect that. I think this is a historical necessity. We talk about slavery sometimes as if black folks were just submissively accepting and enduring what happened, but that was certainly not the case and people were resisting in all kinds of ways. And I really appreciate many of the black feminist historians who I quote who talk about how black women resisted in all kinds of ways on a daily basis the violence of slavery. So I wanted similarly reflect the ways in which people are resisting in all kinds of ways the daily police violence that black women and women of color are subjected to and I wanted to illustrate how looking at this issue through the lens of women's experiences might shift the ways in which we resist, might expand the demands that we make. For instance, if we are going to make a demand about excessive force policy, we are going to make sure that it addresses excessive force against pregnant people. If we're going to make a demand about anything else, we're going to do that in a way that reflects multiple experiences of a particular problem. That we are going to evaluate our responses also through the lens of, 'is this actually going to reduce police violence against black women and women of color or is just going to shift the form that it takes?'",

      "content": "Racial capitalism, as far as Cedric Robinson, the late political scientist, understands it or explained it basically was built based on this idea that capitalism itself is not distinct from racism. The way we think of racism is that racism is a by-product of capitalism. That is, capitalism emerges and racism is a way to divide workers. It’s a way to extract greater value from, say, enslaved people, Indigenous people, etc. But what Cedric argued was that the grounds of the civilization in which capitalism emerges is already based on racial hierarchy. And that racial hierarchy is not necessarily the global one, it’s even within Europe itself that racial distinctions were ways in which early capitalism was able to take advantage of certain groups over others, whether it’s in terms of wages, whether it’s in terms of dispossession and forcing people off the land, using violence against the Irish, for example. We don’t think of the Irish as a racialized group, but in many ways, in the 16th century, that’s what they were.\n\nAnd so if you think of race as assigning meaning to whole groups of people, convincing, ideologically convincing others that some people are inferior to others, that some people are designed as beasts of burden and other people are designed to accept, to embrace the wealth of that, then what you end up getting is a system of extraction that allows for a kind of super-exploitation of Black and brown people. And racial capitalism also relies on an ideology or racial regime, and the racial regime convinces a lot of white people, who may get the crumbs of this extraction through slavery, through Jim Crow, through land disposession, convince them to be or support or shore up a regime that seems to benefit whiteness based in white supremacy but where their own share of the spoils is actually pretty miniscule. Du Bois called this the “wages of whiteness.” It’s like an ideological wage that doesn’t always translate materially. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t.\n\nSo if you think of capitalism as racial capitalism, then the outcome is you cannot eliminate capitalism, overthrow it, without the complete destruction of white supremacy, of the racial regime under which it’s built. And we can see how this works with the police all the time. I mean, when we talk about the police and we talk about defunding the police, we know of the police as generators of revenue, currently. That there’s an accumulation of fees and fines that the police rely on. We also talk about the kinds of support that police unions get, qualified immunity, for example, is part of the contract. We think of qualified immunity only in terms of the power of police unions against a democratic state that says, oh we actually want to tamp down on that. But, if you think about what the police do, the police protect capital. The police were designed to protect property going back to, not just the slave patrols, but even the system of jails in cities in the 19th century. Those jails were designed to hold fugitives, runaways. When you’re trying to track down a runaway slave you pay a jail a fee to hold that enslaved person until the master could come, identify the person, and take them back into slavery. So when you think about the whole system of policing, it’s organized around property. Protecting property against union strikes. Protecting property against anti-racist movements. Protecting property against workers in subjugated groups. So if that’s the point of the police, then we shouldn’t be surprised that qualified immunity or that the violent acts of the police would be supported by capital. Why is that? Because capital needs a police force that could terrify people. That’s what the police do. So when we look at the relationship between the cost of police, the police budgets, and the amount of money being shelled out to settle police misconduct cases, we’re talking about billions.",

Organizers of the local In Defense of Black Lives Dallas coalition surveyed hundreds of Dallas residents last year to create a People’s Budget in favor of cutting Dallas Police Department’s budget by $200 million and reinvesting in community care. Their current demands include funding for a non-police violence prevention office, mental health programs, emergency housing, economic development, recovery for the impacts of the pandemic and the unprecedented winter storm that hit the U.S. South this year, as well as decriminalization of poverty. The summer before George Floyd was murdered, an influx of state troopers was deployed to Dallas to address community violence, resulting in daily police harassment of local residents. On top of this, the winter storm resulted in deaths, displacement, economic hardship, damage to people’s homes and exorbitant debts to exploitative gas companies. In Defense of Black Lives Dallas’s platform is about defunding police in order to offer real solutions that get at the roots of interconnected problems of policing, structural violence and community violence. Mercedes Fulbright of In Defense of Black Lives explains that the coalition wants to “focus more on the affirmative, liberatory vision” in this year’s efforts.",

That includes myself, graphic artist Wesley Taylor, performer sound engineer Carlos Garcia, music producer and filmmaker Waajeed, and community organizer lyricist Ill Weaver Invincible. The five of us have been working together over the last six or seven years now as a collective to build performance installations that support local organizing. So at the core, we’re Complex Movements and the word complex comes from our collective belief that complexity science gives us a new way to think about how change happens in the world. It moves from this idea of critical mass to critical connections so at the core of all of our work is like: How are we supporting connections being made locally, trans-locally, person to person,  individually? What are the cultural  practices  that help do that? And we do that through large scale immersive environments. A lot of our work is based on the work of Grace Lee Boggs who I  mentioned a little earlier. And other folks who started thinking about, in the midst of movement, having had long community organizing practices, started thinking about how there are different ways we could be making change. Right? The way we've been told change happens, is actually a part of what is trying to keep us further from the change that could actually turn the tide. So that's the core of Complex  Movements. We're going to change the way people think about making change by creating immersive artistic  experiences that help create new strategies for local organizing. When we say new  strategies, those aren't always campaigns against the government, but really at the core of what I think about culture is like how we be together — like how are we being together. And  how do we  look and understand each other and the  people around us as resources and sources? My friend Kim Peavey would say, there's resources, that's great, but we want to get at the source — and the source is like our soul space. How are we connecting in our humanity and dignity?",

For her “Banner Project,” Halsey remixes signs, symbols, and Afrofuturist visions inspired by the visual vernacular of her neighborhood, including posters, advertising, and tags. She juxtaposes them with works from the ancient cultures of Egypt and Nubia that she selected from the MFA’s collection. She also takes inspiration from the aesthetic output of the 1970s, such as the Italian speculative architecture collective Superstudio and the music collective, Parliament-Funkadelic.\n\nThese banners are, in the words of the artist, “fantastical cartographies”—maps that trace heritage from the African continent to the contemporary Black and African-American diasporas in the United States.\n\nOf her work Halsey says, “I want to compel folks and myself. . . . I want to compel dreaming, new aspirations, proposals for the future. . . . I’m interested in . . . making gorgeous black space for Black people . . . what I hope to be future spaces that are actually functional in a neighborhood as habitats. Not just representations of architectures as maquettes in an art gallery or museum but the everyday experience of living with it and in it.” Engaged in caring for and reimagining the social bonds in her community, Halsey sees these banners as blueprints to imagine new futures, both local and global, that celebrate and protect Black life.",

Ultimately, her confidence, swag and conviction, her commitment to taking risks and pushing the boundaries, is what I believe makes her a true style icon.” “Missy is so personable and warm and fuzzy and confident and shy, if that makes sense?” said Ambrose. “There’s a coyness to her. When you think about the word coy, Missy is the epitome. Clever but she still knows how to work it. Since I’ve known her, for over 22 years, she’s always been that way.” Ambrose points to the “Lose It” music video, as an indicator of how ahead of her time Elliott has been. “We had a lot of girls dressed like boys, which is such a relevant moment as we talk about gender-bending and being gender neutral today. She was really on the pulse of that early, showing that girls can be in tank tops.” Ambrose believes that’s part of why Elliott’s style changed hip-hop. “We were all about body image,” she says. “No matter what size you are, you can say confidently, ‘This is who I am.’ No matter what shape or size, color or gender, it doesn’t matter.”",

I loved dance: Lola Falana, Alvin Ailey, Jerome Robbins. And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs. I had science projects and tons of astronomy books. I took calculus and philosophy. I wondered about infinity and the Big Bang theory.

Now, my mother helped me figure that one out. But when I went into space, I carried a number of things up with me. I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey -- you can figure out now, I love the dance company -- an Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance \"Cry,\" dedicated to all black women everywhere; a Bundu statue, which was from the women's society in Sierra Leone; and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math. And folks asked me, \"Why did you take up what you took up?\" And I had to say, \"Because it represents human creativity; the creativity that allowed us, that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle, which springs from the same source as the imagination and analysis that it took to carve a Bundu statue, or the ingenuity it took to design, choreograph and stage \"Cry.\" Each one of them are different manifestations, incarnations, of creativity -- avatars of human creativity.",

The images explore the notion of longing, the desire for an alternate state of being for Blackness. Critiquing history, the present and beckoning the future, all at the same time. A reference I can point to is John Akomfrah’s documentary The Last Angel of History. If you were to imagine a Black Indigenous data hacker on a quest to displace their community from a world of suffering, then I’d imagine the black beyond Instagram could very well be their visual journal. The images on our page also parallel a piece that is currently in development for our upcoming exhibition, but I can’t go into too many details at this time. To say the least, it’s a nonlinear, immersive experience. Can we ever escape the white gaze ? How can we work to minimize its effect on our art and practice? Right now, I’m more concerned with Black and Indigenous presence in order to minimize the impact of white gaze. As we reclaim space, we have to confront and unravel white colonialism and imperialism. It’s important to have true allyship in order to do this work.  As Saul Williams says in “Coded Language” from his 2001 album Amethyst Rock Star, “We are unraveling our navels so that we may ingest the sun. We are not afraid of the darkness. We trust that the moon shall guide us. We are determining the future at this very moment. We know that the heart is the philosopher’s stone. Our music is our alchemy.” Black spirituals preserve our tormented spirit. A spirit enduring centuries of transgenerational trauma. On molecular, metaphysical and literal levels. The ‘literal’ redacted and encoded messages, embedded in song and dance rituals that were used as a means to escape plantations and to navigate foreign landscapes. Black rituals and spirituals help ground and transcend us through these states of refuge. Song and dance rituals have evolved: from Gullah Islands, Black spaces of worship in the South, jazz,  rhythm and blues, resilient rap, futuristic house and experimental techno beats. Our music may be popular, but our messages remain encoded for those who can translate the sound of this movement. I do have ideas of how the negro spiritual and the Black digital spiritual will manifest, but that legend belongs in the streets.",

Nobody started walking backwards or anything like that and the fact that we are passing backwards into the seasons will offer no real indication either, since global warming has already made humans used to irregular weather patterns. No, neither the human mind nor body works like, it doesn’t handle change very well. At first, the mind-body, fearing what is unfamiliar, creates whatever illusion is necessary to ensure its survival. But in subtle ways, over time, apparently whether it’s unwinding or rewinding, change begins to work its way on both the body and the mind, oozing and setting into the cracks of things until a new reality presents itself to you as a smooth whole one day. It is now November 7, nearly two months into The Shift, and people can increasingly remember what used to be the future. What used to be the past, our already lived experiences and memories, grow hazier each day. Past memories now only show up in the world of dreams for most of us, evaporating with the morning dew like any other dream. Eventually it begins to sink in that the future and the recent present is now behind us. We are now witnessing history become the yet-to-come.

      "content": "FANON’S REVOLUTION.  I am making the hypothesis that the modern world has actually been  brought into being on the basis of three very powerful revolutions. One was the “Copernican Revolution,\" which gave rise to the physical sciences. The next was the \"Darwinian Revolution,\" which gave rise to the biological  sciences. And Fanon's revolution is the one that will give rise to an entirely  new science, which will be that of the nature-culture mode of being human. Notice. This is very important. It's not one or the other (nature versus cul­ture). It is the co-relation. Fanon came up with this in his book, Black Skins, White Masks. What he suggested is that—he wanted to find out for himself:  He said,  \"Look. In the Caribbean it is normal for the Antillean subject to be anti-Black, to be anti-Negro.\" But he said, if you went to Africa and  you saw the Pygmy in his traditional cultural constellation, there he is the normal human being. And it is impossible for him to experience himself as a Negro because he is the norm, and to be a Negro is to be the opposite  to the norm.  \n\nThen Fanon made the leap. He said that if a Black person can be aver­sive to himself, so that—just as the White person is—the White person will shout, \"dirty nigger,\" but the Black person will also have that same response to himself—then this is because, in the case of the human, while Freud spoke about the ontogenetic subject, that is to say, the ontogenetic individual (let us think of the child: it's born as an embryo, the embryo  grows—we watch with awe as this beautiful miracle unfolds itself). But, Fanon said that from the moment this is happening, it is also being social­ized within the terms of a specific—we have to use the word \"culture,\"  we have no better word—a specific cultural conception of what it is to  be human; of what it is to be a good man or woman of your kind. And I  so Fanon says, in the case of the human, besides \"ontogeny,\" there is \"so­ciogeny”. And the moment we have said that, we now have moved outside of an entirely biological conception of being which underlies our present conception. We live in a mode of sociogeny, a conception of the human, in which to be human you must be anti-Black. This is the point he is making.\n\nTHE WELL-BEING OF THE HUMAN VS ETHNO-CLASS 'MAN’.  We define the human as homo-economicus. What we call capitalism is the  only mode of production that can produce the material conditions of ex­istence of the definition of the human as homo-economicus. That is why,  although our economies in the third world want a new economic order, we cannot have a new economic order. This is the best that we can possibly hope for within the terms of the conception of the human as an economic being. But, if we now move toward the conception of the human as being fundamentally a social being, a being that is always instituting itself as  social, and we then ask: The economic system we have now functions for the well-being of the ethno-class conception of the human man. What,  system of economics would we need to function for the well-being, not just of the global middle classes, but of the human itself? People are massively  poor in the midst of great abundance. Never before has the productive capacity of humankind been greater. So, therefore, we are faced with a contradiction.  \n\nObviously I the contradiction has to do with distribution. So the question then is: What determines distribution? Adam Smith gave a wonderful clue, when he was attacking the landlord class and he said—you know the  landlord has these vast fields and he enjoys the products, but his stomach is limited. So he can not eat all that food, right? So he has to distribute it. But what drives him to distribute that little that he pays his workers is due to his desire to keep up and to reproduce his “economy of greatness”. Marx told us the key is the mode of production. I knew he was partly right. And then I realized what is produced is not just the material conditions. What is produced is our conception of being human. Every mode of production is a function of producing that conception. That is why our system of capitalist production, brilliant as it is, cannot deal with the issue of the poor or the impoverished nations. Because its function is to produce for the well-being of the global middle classes—for a conception of the human. And so our  great problem now, the great struggle is between the well-being of \"Man\" or the well-being of the human.",

The  city’s built environment reflected the economic shifts. The tax  base dwindled, pushed downward by derelict retail establishments as well as declining paychecks. Proposition 13 had al-  ready shrunken the taxable basis of real property. Capital lacked  local markets because growers such as Salyer had pushed borrowing to the limit in the previous decade, whereas Boswell,  continuing the march toward monopoly, had money in the bank  and could finance expansion without recourse to crippling debt  (Reisner 1986). The local state could not act to connect California’s then-abundant finance capital with local surpluses because,  in spite of its legal capacity to issue debt for public works, it  lacked the tax base to pay off such loans: better-off homeowners  were too wary, agricultural workers were too poor, and the  dominant cotton empires were too impervious. Alternative  medium-run development schemes—such as residential suburbanization—were not an option, because Corcoran lay outside  Central Valley growth paths, as evidenced by the lack of commercial or individual takers for low-priced homes, empty buildings, and unbuilt land. In the aggregate, Corcoran’s surpluses added to the city’s crisis. THE SEARCH FOR A PRISON FIX. As Corcoran’s chronic unemployment translated into child  poverty rates running above 30 percent, the challenge to secure  the future propelled townspeople to request state intervention in  the form of a multimillion dollar prison. In 1983, Corcoran  learned that Avenal (pop. 4,137), in the non-producing Kettleman  Plains oilfields of western Kings County, had had a 3,000-bed  prison authorized by the state legislature. That May, the Corcoran City Council directed the city manager, George Lambert, to  ask County Supervisor Joe Hammond whether Sacramento  might be amenable to siting a prison in Corcoran as well. While appointed and elected officials lobbied in pursuit of legislative authorization for a Corcoran prison, the city also entered  into dialogue with CDC Siting Office staff to gain a better sense  of the costs and benefits of a prison as an economic development  project. In the 1980s and 1990s, the CDC marketing professionals presented every new prison establishment as an open-ended  good. The spiral-bound, clear-plastic-covered proposal they sent  out to inquiring townsfolk was not a slick, flashy publication;  rather, the photocopied document was simply written and neatly  illustrated with maps, plans, and timelines. In a consistently optimistic tone, it enumerated the kinds of benefits a locality would  gain from the facility, and what made the optimism persuasive  was the modesty of the promises. A struggling working-class  town such as Corcoran could make direct connections between  what it is and what it might be if a prison were added to the local economic mix.",

On an overcast afternoon, the park is relatively quiet, save for the occasional squawk of migrating geese and the distant groan of the Metro-North winding up the Hudson. A solitary jogger lopes along a dirt path edging the dense woods. “I love this park because it’s the last of the forest as it used to be, before we showed up and fucked up everybody’s shit,” fantasy writer NK Jemisin tells me as we set off through the woods, her hands tucked pensively into the pockets of a long gray cardigan. After a moment, she adds an important caveat. “Well, I mean, technically my ancestors weren’t fucking anybody up. They were just being fucked up. That said … ” She drifts off, her eyes on the red oaks overhead. Reality always creeps into Jemisin’s fantasies, whether she wants it to or not.\n\nWe’re here on a research expedition to gather details for a scene in her new trilogy, which she describes as a magical battle for the soul of New York City.\n\n“I just want to write about things blowing up. Gods and planets and moons crashing into things,” she tells me. “But what I write ends up being very political. If I write about dragons, I’m writing about dragons as a black woman, and it’s fucking political.”\n\nAs one character tells another, “Some worlds are built on a fault line of pain, held up by nightmares. Don’t lament when those worlds fall. Rage that they were built doomed in the first place.”\n\nThe Broken Earth is set, those who wield orogeny can raise mountains by reaching, with their minds, into the molten magma of the earth. For their talents, they are subjugated by a society that needs and fears them in equal measure.\n\n“Gentrification is all about taking uniqueness and color and complexity of a city and trying to reduce it to something controllable and less frightening.\n\nAs we stand beside the boulder that she’s come all the way up here to see, she turns in a circle, snapping photographs on her phone of the nearby trees and hiking trails. Looking around, she notices that the setting isn’t precisely as she’d pictured it, based on her perusals of Google maps. The bench she’d imagined a character would be sitting on is 40 yards from where she thought it would be, and facing the wrong direction. The grass that she pictured a character lying on is thicker than she expected. “Nobody’s going to be lying down in that,” she observes.\n\nJemisin is a builder and destroyer of worlds, but really, there’s only one she cares about. And in that world, there’s a city with a park where the grass is a little thicker than expected. She looks at it wearily and sighs. “I’ll have to revise the scene.",

      "content": "I really wanted to get into what the constellation of Detroit techno was. What was its makeup? I wanted to draw links that I’d heard of and knew already but that I hadn’t seen presented audio-visually before, no matter how disparate or obvious these links seemed. I particularly wanted to situate techno as what I’ve described previously as a resulting sound that is a sum of its historic, social, and musical history. By this I mean that it is in the lineage of Black American music as well as the history of movement and technology in relation to Black folks in America.\n\nIt’s one of my favorites, too, and has been the audience favorite at every single screening! On a foundational level it speaks to the relationship between soul and the machine in Detroit, and it recenters women in combat to the general erasure of women, particularly Black women from the history of music generally and particularly electronic music. It’s also an intergenerational commentary in that you see three women of three different generations who are so important to the shaping of the Detroit sound spinning together. It’s a rapturous scene. The factory is owned by a Nigerian brother in Detroit, and it is a live, moving factory during work hours. Nothing stopped for us; we took up the space, did our thing, and it was the perfect circumstantial analogy of what Black women stay doing. \n\nOn a personal level I’m in a constant state of spiritual conversation. My work allows for a 3D synthesis of some of those deep feelings, thoughts, and conversations as it relates to my being here on earth. On a more macro level my work aims to encourage people to be curious in all things—themselves, history, the world, and all we deem to be true. It’s somewhat of a forceful encouragement, as I’m presenting my ideas sophisticatedly but also directly and unapologetically.\n\nAh, it’s funny, as the one I’m about to mention always gets dismissed as not being quintessentially techno, but it’s “Timeline” by Galaxy 2 Galaxy. The ghettotech sped-up version is my fave. “Cybotron Clear,” which I first came to via Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control,” is an obvious fave too. What’s yours?",

      "content": "You’re right in that there are these three spaces or architectures that are absolutely foundational to my work: the Atlantic, the hold, and the circle. And I think that the circle is a central figure when trying to describe black radical imaginaries and anti-slavery philosophy, from Frederick Douglass’s description of the circle as a space of sociality and radical thought, to the historian Sterling Stuckey, who looks at circle formations in African American culture, tracing them to Congo culture – specifically, the Bakongo cosmogram. So all that is to say that I think you’re right that the circle is this deep, diasporic formation that travels with us. It’s so rich with the potential of relation, possibility, care, other modes of understanding – it’s the knowledge we have and make with one another. And that’s why Douglass is so pivotal for me. It may seem like nonsense to the outside world, but in here we know it is a tome of philosophy. It resonates with Édouard Glissant’s discussion about ‘the right to opacity’. Lose Your Mother closes with a circle formation. In Gwolu, these young girls give me the possibility of another language of relation – and I think that I became aware of the gift after the fact; it wasn’t that I was trying to build or even assume a connection. In Wayward Lives there is a beautiful stark image of the Atlantic, and as I was writing, I reflected on why it was important to have this image in the book. It is one of the spaces or milieux that define blackness. Alongside the circle, the hold, the colony, the native quarter, the carceral landscape. The circle forms inside the enclosure and even in the worst circumstances, there is making and relation.\n\nIt was exactly my intention for the text to be polyphonic, to conjure the multivocality of the chorus and the spoken character of utterance. One of the things that was really important for me to convey was the sensorium of black urban space, and that is so much about sound, right? The intimacy and proximity and overhearing of this shared utterance. I wanted to create that sense of not just a spoken text but a text that’s created by this multiplicity of utterance and that sometimes it speaks in multiple ways, like girl, you’re too much, you know? The description of the ‘too much’ of blackness or the ‘too much’ of the wayward and not wanting to be disciplined by the disciplinary apparatus. In large measure, what the practice of citation does is reproduce intellectual hierarchies. Whose words must be accounted for? Whose words are endowed with autonomy or must be treated as if valuable and private property, as opposed to the kind of taken-for-granted utterances that are credited to no one in particular. I wanted to level all of that.\n\nWhat is joy? What is joy? I tend to describe joy as this experience of transformation or release from the constraint or costume of the individual or the subject into this other form. So, for me I think it’s about floating, it’s about being nothing and being everything at the same time; this sense of the self disappearing in the context of the vastness of the earth, the ocean, the sky, the land. That kind of joy is always about self-dissolution, escape. And my favourite colour? My garden in full bloom. I’m a gardener, so I love the colours in my garden and I love just playing with colours. I’ll show you my dahlias (shows image on phone), these are from my garden. Deep purples, deep burgundies towards black. The garden’s blackest flowers. And finally, I don’t know if I would have a question or advice, but probably the advice that I would give myself would be something like ‘don’t despair’. Don’t despair.",

      "content": "I’m sure that possibility exists. I think that there are certain similar aspects. What I got out of church was the social function, and also the music that reached towards very lofty heights. The church, especially the one I grew up in, can aspire to and reach towards the sublime and it is a place for self- expression through mutual recognition with other people. It’s a self-selecting community, which means it is open to everyone, but you are there by choice. You recognise something in each other and you choose to participate. These collective rituals allow you to work through all the difficulties of life, but also to celebrate the beauty of life. I think that, particularly, for black people – I grew up in the South, so I grew up in a Southern Black Baptist Church – you deal with a lot. There is a lot of bullshit you have to deal with every day; there is a lot of financial stress, family stress, inherited trauma, inherited mental ailments and spiritual ailments. This creates a lot of cycles that are hard to break, and I think that church is, or can be, an opportunity to break those and use the really aspirational art form of music, dance and language play to do that.\n\nI don’t know if there’s necessarily such a direct transfer as “This is the preacher, this is the choir”. For me, this transfer between the church and the club is not through equivalence, but a through a larger function. So, maybe a DJ could be a form of preacher, depending on the way you approach it. Some music avoids lyrics and avoids language and there are a lot of genres of music and a lot of ways of DJing that work through the extralinguistic, outside of language. So, sure, it could be.\n\nI think for me, for that show, I was thinking through the performance of visibility economies and less about questions of truth. There Are Certain Facts that Cannot Be Disputed was about fact-hood, knowledge production, history – what is a historical fact and who can lay claim to that and how does that affect fundamental feelings of humanness and the pageantry of history and antiquity. Snatch the Calf Back, for me, was a lot of things. I try not to over- prescribe how my work should be read, but it is kind of about visibility economy and identity politics and being in an era in which so many things are being read through the context of visibility; and ‘liberations’ of certain groups, like non-binary people or indigenous people, would come through giving them a sort of visibility campaign. Like, if Laverne Cox in a H&M campaign implies “that’s a win for all trans people”, it is assumed visibility is the same as the shifting of political, economic and cultural resources.\n\nBut also, to me, it is about over-performing humanness to a limit. I am interested less in a conservative idea of proscribing the binary that re-inscribes ideas of the binary in transness. Western/Non-Western binary is etched into these new kinds of political economies that are limiting identity. I have been interested in the contact between human and animal, that I think historically, politically and culturally appears in discourse countering same-sex rights – as if same-sex marriage would lead to bestiality. Or, if you let men identify as women, or women identify as men, then you might as well let anyone identify as an animal, as a dolphin or a tarantula. So, I asked myself, what is at work in the anxiety surrounding that? Also, activist resistance to conservative ways of thinking for the inclusion of identity rights inspired me.\n\nThe encounter between human and animal became an interesting way for me to think about the limit of the representational matrix. What are the contours and hard boundaries of what we think of as physical and worthy of visibility? That’s what I’ve been working through – thinking of transness, the explosion of transness into interspecies and the role of body modification in between all of these boundaries. To me it is more interesting to go there than to try and avoid them. I guess it’s an initiation, for me, of a form of identity anarchy. Maybe that’s what I’m actually trying to push for or think through, advocating for a form of anarchy – both semantic anarchy and anarchy in terms of what you are allowed to do with your body, where you are allowed to push your body. Everyone should have free hormones. You know, in a certain way, I am all for genetic modification! Of course, based on consent, and thinking of a world where that’s possible.",

Those are the weights that hold the sails up in the sky, and then underneath the video projections are just still slides that are all kinds of aerial photographs of the planet itself or of constellations. It gets very macro. I feel like each table is populated by random objects, like an incense burner, a feather, a book, some dice, a bottle of prescription pills, a statue of a cat, it’s super granular, like a cosmological question. When I’m talking about “We Already Have What We Need,” what I’m really trying to talk about is our anxiety as human beings about how to live. We have so much anxiety about it, that we tend to hoard and accumulate and in doing so, we do a lot of harm. And that hoarding and accumulating also results in famine. There is enough. There’s already right now enough for everyone.",

During the winter you might freeze back in this little end, because the house is so raggly and it's shady. But we have so many hot days in the winter. It don't never stay winter. It switches to a hot day today, and a cold, and a hot day today, and you got to keep up with the weather, and then it switches.\n\nSo I been here ten years. Slavering. Nothing but slavering. You can't do nothing here, and can't get away if you want to. I waited on them two older peoples. One of them's dead now; the lady died last May. The old guy's in the home up in Greensboro.

      "name": "Thornton Dial",
      "content": "I got this drawing about a bulldog. It’s showing you something about life, how the Negro always be hunting for something if he need it, and how he got to hunt all day, and sometimes he don’t catch nothing. Like Little Buck [Thornton Dial Jr.] say on a bad day sometimes, “Can’t kill nothing and won’t nothing die.” Like the government working the man all day and he didn’t get nothing in his life, and if he do finally catch something the government want half of it. \n\nI lived that life, the back part of my life, coming on up like a bull in the pasture. Doing the work on the farm, chopping wood, toting brush. These are my pictures. I was part of the capture, lonely in those times. No freedom. But I was still flying like a bird. Inside me, picking up things, life always running good. I always had that mind, the dream of life, vision, that I could go up in the world. And thinking about the changing of life when you get up. \n\nSince I been making art, my mind got more things coming to it. The more you do, the more you see to do. The spirit works off the mind and get stronger. Like an angel following you around. Angel watching over you is just the life in your own body. \n\nMy art is the evidence of my freedom. When I start any piece of art I can pick up anything I want to pick up. When I get ready for that, I already got my idea for it. I start with whatever fits with my idea, things I will find anywhere. I gather up things from around. I see the piece in my mind before I start, but after you start making it you see more that need to go in it. It’s just like inventing something. It’s like patterns that you cut out to show you how to make something—a boxcar, or clothes. Everything got a pattern for it. The pattern for a piece of art is in your mind; it’s the idea for it. That’s the pattern.\n\nI build a piece of art with those materials first, and then paint the thing. Art is future life, and I try to match up colors that fit that life. Art supposed to show the way the world is: sometimes dark, sometimes light. A piece of art is like the movement of the clouds, or the sun in the sky, like the works of the United States go, constant moving, always changing. The movement of the world always make changes in things. When I make art I have to keep making changes till I get it right. People say, “Hey Dial, that piece look good, ain’t it finished?” I say, “Nope, it ain’t finished till you got the feeling that it’s finished.” I like to touch every picture all over the surface of it. It got to be a finished product. I like to work on that surface, rub it, scratch it, smear it. I beat on it sometimes, knock holes in it. I have even set fire to it. I want that finished piece to be exactly right when it leave my hands. The piece going to have Mr. Dial in it, under it, and over it, and everybody can know it.\nWhen I went to making art on plywood, I drawed it out first with a pencil, and after that I put on the other materials, stuff I find or stuff I have, like the steel, carpet, and old tin, and then I paint it. But under all those things I did a big drawing to guide what I put on top of it. If I wasn’t drawing under there, I was cutting out with a jigsaw. I cut the figures out of plywood, then the leftover pieces become something else in the next picture. Everything you pick up going to do you some good. Don’t nothing need to be throwed away. I could cut whatever out of a piece of plywood. I could imitate anything: a dog, a person, a tiger, a building, or a cloud. I paid attention to those things at that time. People got to pay attention to every little thing they do.\nAfter while I just went to building my pieces right on to the board. I didn’t need to draw them out. Cutting out tin and carpet and stuff come natural like drawing. The mind do the imagining. I got where I could bend and twist the old materials as beautiful as I could draw it out with a pencil.\nI was raised by women. It did a whole lot for me. Coming up in the world that way make me realize what struggle they have. Make me understand how to be a man.\nI have learned to make a beautiful picture by just using pencils and charcoal. The rubbing and the smearing is the struggle to make something beautiful with your own hands. I don’t use much color stuff now. You can make a lot of different colors only with black. I reckon every artist figured out that kind of stuff way back there.\n\nI have learned a whole lot about drawing from my work at the Pullman Factory. Designs was punched out in the iron and steelworks; big, beautiful pieces of steel start out with a little design. They drawed out the designs for the templates on paper, then make them on wood, then bring them to be punched into iron to go on the train car. I got to seeing how things you draw out can be the design for everything. Everything in the world got a pattern. The mind got to see it, the hands got to make it.\n\nI been gone out there picking up lot of pieces. Everything I pickup be something that done did somebody some good in their lifetime. So I’m picking up on their spirit. It’s going to make you think about the work, the labor, what good they have did. When you make things beautiful out of another person’s ideas, it make the world more beautiful. I been studying a lot of stuff. Now I’m going to build it. The material I get, there was a design to it before I get it. Then you got to come back and redesign it.",

The symbols and numbers (seven and eleven, for example) are about \"good luck and power.\" The initials \"D. S.\" on one door belong to \"someone I knew,\" he says, unwilling to elaborate. A drawing of a hornet is included on another door as an indication of \"the power to control the bee.\" There are also more feathered caps, and jars and containers filled with herbs, fungi, and roots, and lucky charms . . . and more roots.

I belong to God, and all things belong to God, because it's in his Word that all things are made to him, that without him there's not anything made. I know that my art is a peculiar kind of an art, but he says that his people are peculiar people and I just want to give all the praise and glory to him for my work. My work is something that tells of love, and he is love, so he let the insects and time and nature go in front and do the work and then he gives me the insight to bring it out.

And I kind of see the Scriptures a little different to some people, because I see people as trees, living trees, and I see our fruits that we bear, some good and some bad. But we're not responsible when we use the bad fruit, and the one that has the good fruit is to show good fruit to the one that has bad fruit, that they will learn to enjoy good fruit, and not hate the corrupt fruit within them. And then that way we are building a place for the Paradise to return. But as long as we hate and can't love, as long as we judge and think we're not judged, as long as we condemn and not be condemned, so we think the world will never be what God intended it to be.

And then he makes in front of us a mannequin of his own vision to let us know, \"Hey, life is still sitting in the midst of you all. Someone labored for this life, someone is there, this image is in my mind, my brother, my bad experience, getting hit, being blind.\" That echo, these sounds that still going on in his head, and when he has a fade-out in the air and every now and then one of those little trinkets that he have out there may make a sound. You can hear his sitting out in his yard, and all of his art is making these different sounds, because he had finally created his own kind of symphony orchestra, that he can sit quietly. Because I'm sure people picked at him because of his eyesight.

A vision of him taking a hike to the mountain, seeing a wildflower, all of these mountains and rivers he had made with so many different levels of painting, and then to talk about the atmosphere, and to see our earthly habitat in the habitations on our earth. You can see Joe Light just telling you all: Forget all about this bad stuff that we have had done to us and let's make it more beautiful.",

She say she believed Jesus dwelt there. So, I sat under that old oak tree to meditate and read the Bible and pray for an answer. I went on a fast for thirty days. On that thirtieth day, a beautiful light just shone. And I looked up, saw it shining in heaven, and I thought, Instead of taking my life, God’s fixing to come back here at me. And that beautiful light just came over my spirit and said to me, “Get a door and paint.” I already had a pile of doors there, and had paint, and I went and did it. In the Gospel of John, Jesus says, “I am the door; if anyone enters by me, he will be saved.” And I was writing on them doors. And I was releasing myself. I painted things I could remember that my grandmother said to me. And I kept painting and painting until I filled the yard up. And my spirit was relieved of all my pain. The hurting was being taken away. The painting brought me through.\n\nMy mission is just to paint it and get it out there. I come straight out with my art. My art talks straight up. My messages are the truth. I’m finding out that people don’t always like the truth. People that go to church every Sunday, they want to hear the truth? Naw. They just want to hear what fits their ears. That’s gotten me a little tight, people kind of attack me, ’cause I speak it out like it is. The truth, they say, will set us free. I got to paint it the way I feel, and if I change, people are going to know God didn’t tell me that. I could paint all the birds and cats I wanted to, but it ain’t me. Some people prefer you come out with something like a voodoo doll. One woman cam and wanted a red window. I tried to do it five times and finally said, “Forget this, they going to take what I got, or they don’t need it.” I refuse to let people change me. I started painting because of love and healing, and if things don’t go the way I think they should go, I’ll find another avenue.",

It holds together just like the regular molding clay. I get some clay south of Leland, down at Black Bottom, too. The name of it really is black gumbo, but some people call it buckshot because it’s so sticky it takes a buck to run through it. It is sticky. I’ve known places where people raised chickens, and come a rain those little baby chickens they’d get stuck in that clay. It’d be all balled up under their feet.\n\nWhen it rains, I let the clay soak up the water. Sometimes I mix a little wax with it to help hold it together. It cracks open real bad if you work with it like it is. Then I put hair grease on there to smooth it down and get the wrinkles out of it. Like if I make something and I don’t want to work on it any more until tomorrow, I put me some towels across there and wet towels to keep it soft. But it don’t dry out too fast. Then after I get it worked out, I put putty on it. That’s for if it happens to crack, that putty would still be holding and you couldn’t see the crack, unlessen it got real bad.\n\nI put match heads in there for the eyes. That’s in case you want to paint his eyes, so when it dries you can spot them. That way you’ll know the direct place where you want them at. You can just take the matches out and paint the eyes in there. The eyes should be clear and plain, just like a picture you take with a camera.” There is one thing I’d like to improve on and that’s the eyes. You have to draw your eyes in there before you can get them lined up. Your eyes are on a level with your ears. They can’t be a bit higher than your ears and they can’t be no lower. They got to be the same level your ears is and that’s why you don’t have no trouble making glasses. If some people’s eyes was down below their nose, they couldn’t get no glasses to ﬁt them. If I ever get the eyes just like I want to, I can make any kind of future.\n\nIf I could get to a mountain where they have this clay like I use, I believe I could do me a whole man. I believe I could put a whole statue of a man standing up in that mountain. If the clay worked right, I could start at the head and come right down to the feets. I believe I could work a statue as big as a man. I believe I could make him just as tall as me or you if I could get the right height dirt where I was going to work at. That’s six foot high. Give me plenty of room to pull it all together and just make it in the bank and then put me some kind of paint on there to finish it up. I haven’t ever did it, but I believe I could do it.",

      "content": "We all are capable of causing change and many of us have been doing magic for quite some time such as breathing exercises, working with plants, meditation, wishing on a shooting star, carrying lucky objects, prayer, worshipping and honoring the moon or the sun, sex, sharing our stories with others, community work, activism, re-naming ourselves, re-claiming our bodies, engaging in decolonial practices, burning incense, carrying crystals around, making altars, paying attention to our dreams, using essential oils, engaging in tarot, allowing ourselves to be moved by each other, by art, and by music. But what if that work became more intentional and we became more confident in our powers?\n\nWe are called to create our own realities, to question and evaluate what is presented to us, and to understand the limitations of any system that we chose to abide by or use.\n\nTo believe in magic is to believe in change and to believe in the power of changing yourself and your environment and effectively the collective as it is all connected.\n\nAnother thing that feels necessary to mention, is that magic has always existed and is functioning in ways that are also extremely harmful. During the violent forced shift toward capitalism in Europe and in the Americas, a big portion of that technology was eradicating forms of magic and beings that connected us to each other, us to the land, and us to other-than-human beings. Land, gender, race, and many other ways of being became further enclosed, sequestered off into containers to more easily allow for them to be control. Alongside this was the shift from the collective to the individual and toward a very-limited form of “science” and not to mention, witch hunts, a violent and murderous attack on women, femmes, poor people, disabled people, sex workers, and black and indigenous folks. The purpose of this violence was to initiate a new world order and I believe a big part of restructuring the world was using magic, albeit a harmful one. What is a border? What is money? What is whiteness? What is the gender binary? These are all things that exist simply because of belief, simply because the current consensus reality includes a collection of beliefs that say that these things are both real and necessary. This way of living by adhering to these ideeologiees was not always the case but strong holdedly inspired by magic and its ability to create change.\n\nIt is clear to me that magic works and even those who may not call themselves magicians or witches know that too. Magic had to be eradicated from the masses because a belief in magic is a belief in change, is a belief in creating a new version of the world, is a belief in our own powers, and for many of us it is a belief that we can actually have what we need without buying into capitalism and all its attachments.",

      "content": "The piece that I want to talk about is on screen. It's called a “Monument to the Minds of the Little Steelworkers”. Like Joanne and [indiscernible] and Greg, I'm here to testify not only to Thornton Dial's greatness but also to the fact that he didn't come out of nowhere. He didn't come from nothing. Nothing comes from nothing. Which is what Mr Dial speaks again and again. As in this highly wrought, well wrought, over wrought iron — folded or filled with air and flowers. Like the skeleton of a Charles Babbage fantasy. The difference engine that Mr Dial built and designed is a kind of critical transcendence of private property and of monocultural violence. \n\nAnd what I want to do today, beginning with a couple of epigraphs the length of which I apologize for, is to think about Mr Dial's work in terms of this notion of a critique of private property and a critique of monoculture. So the two passages that I want to quote are — the first one is from Karl Marx's Grundrisse in which he writes, “What is wealth other than the universality of individual needs, capacities, pleasures, productive forces, etc created through universal exchange. The full development of human mastery over the forces of nature, those of so called nature as well as of humanity's own nature. The absolute working out of his creative potentialities with no presupposition other than the previous historic development which makes this totality of development, ie the development of all human powers, as such the end in itself not as measured on a predetermined yardstick. Where he does not reproduce himself in one specificity but produces his totality strives not to remain something he has become but it is in the absolute movement of becoming”. Second quote is from Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s book Commonwealth, “The poor, in other words, refers not to those who have nothing but to the wide multiplicity of all those who are inserted in the mechanisms of social production regardless of social order or property. Multitude defined in this way comes to connote the lowest rank of society and the property lists since they are the most visibly excluded from the dominant political bodies but really it is an open inclusive social body characterized by its boundlessness and its originary state of mixture among social ranks in groups”.\n\nI want to think about Thornton Dial within a specifically Black Marxist frame and problematic but also within the context of a certain radical aesthetic. Of certain radical aesthetic and social interventions made over the last forty years in Italy that fall under the rubric of Arte Povera and autonomous thought. Both of which insofar as they also make something new and something else out of Marx's own innovations can be situated in relation to the question of a non-oppositional relation between wealth and poverty. Insofar as he wields the hammer that Marx and Lenin were thinking about when they said “hammer and sickle” or more recently that Robin Kelly was thinking about when he talked about hammer and hoe. Thornton Dial moves also in these orbits of social theory and socio-poetics and this is not accidental or a function of individual genius. However much Mr Dial emphatically asserts and makes visible everything anyone ever thought they meant by appealing to that notion. I also want to think about Mr Dial as a Black worker in the deep south. Along lines introduced by Hosea Hudson, the great Black Marxist organizer and strategists, who spent time in and around the foundries of Birmingham, Alabama and its environs. And in a different register, Deborah McDowell, the brilliant Black literary critic whose memoir “Leaving Pipe Shop” thinks and illuminates the ordinary heroism that serially appeared in and as the working-class Black social life of the neighborhood in Bessemer, Alabama that she and Mr Dial each provisionally called home. And will have never been said to have completely left or left behind. Consider the way labor unrest and worker insurgency, mutual indebtedness, and supposedly impossible common sociality animated “Pipe Shop”. These elements were a big part of the noise, the background radiation out of which everything emerged as a kind of light or material breath. \n\nI want to talk about the autonomist aesthetic thrust of Black radicalism as something liberation theologians call, “a preferential option for the poor”. But this demands that we ask after Hardt and Negri’s formulation, “If it is not that the poor have nothing, then what do they have and how does this having operate in relation to poverty?”. It requires some consideration of a social economy of dispossession. The social circulation of wealth that is manifest in indebtedness. The poor are the ones without credit but they are indebted to one another. They make a preferential option for one another in an infinite series or incalculable web of small acts of claiming and reclamation, conviviality and commonality, that constitute the renewal of their own sociality and the resistance to whatever attempt to suppress the sociality of the ones who just get up and go to work every day. \n\nThese were the folks my grandfather, much like Mr Dial, called smart. I used to think “the smart” in this usage was simply the opposite of lazy, but I have come to understand that what he meant was that the people who get up and go to work every day, get up and go to school every day. Here's where the question of poverty, and the question of things, is all bound up with the question of study. Consider “Pipe Shop” not only as enclosure and zone of relegation but also as refuge and university. Its inhabitants are the “keenest dialecticians'', as Brecht would say. They study change. They are preoccupied with generativity and its irreducible relation to decay. But what belongs to the poor, to the refugees, to the ones who study change?. Samuel R Delaney says, “In order to have a transition, you need to be armed”. What is the armature, the arsenal of the poor?. The ones who in having nothing, have everything. This question is inseparable from other fundamental questions. Why is there something rather than nothing?. Why are there some things rather than no things?. What is the relationship between something and nothing that animates our understanding of poverty, of the vernacular of the common, of their insurgent force, of their generative but incalculable wealth?. \n\nConsider that we live within the history of a double violation. The denigration of things and the coincident devaluation of people that is carried out by what is supposed to be their reduction to things. We have to linger. Art allows us to linger between something and nothing — nothing and everything — so that we can begin to understand again how the interrelation of wealth and poverty is all bound up with the question, which is to say a study, of things. I would love by way of this trajectory to make a monument to Mr Dial's mind.\n\nThis old- new kind of transcendental aesthetic, off and out in its immanence as the scientific  productivity of such immanence projects, is the unowned, differential, and differentiated  thing itself that we hold out to one another, in the bottom, under our skin, for the general kin, at the rendezvous of victory.\n\nTo say that we have something (only insofar as we relinquish it) is to say that we come from somewhere (only insofar as we leave that place behind). Genesis is dispersion;  somewhere is everywhere and nowhere as the radical dislocation we enact, where we stay  and keep on going, before the beginning, before every beginning, and all belonging, in undercommon variance, in arrivance and propulsion, in the flexed load of an evangelical bridge, passed on this surreptitious vamp, here. If you need some, come on, get some. We come from nothing, which is something misunderstood. It’s not that blackness is not  statelessness; it’s just that statelessness is an open set of social lives whose animaterialized exhaustion remains as irreducible chance. Statelessness is our terribly beautiful open secret, the unnatural habitat, and habitus of analytic engines with synthetic capacities. Preservation is conditional branching, undone computation (tuned, forked, tongued),  improvisation and, what it forges, digital speculation beyond the analogical or  representational or calculative reserve. Critique – for example, the deciphering of the fundamental discursive structures that (de)form Western civilization – is part of its repertoire but it must always be kept in mind that cryptanalytic assertion has a  cryptographic condition of possibility.\n\nSometimes it seems like we are trapped in the correspondence of this assumed legitimacy of exclusion and austerity, in which enclosure is exercised as a kind of right and disposability is understood to be an essential quality of every earthly inhabitant. This is why we are so fortunate that Thornton Dial extends a socio-poetic tradition of studying the eloquence of things. That he is able to see that eloquence as depth, texture, and syntax and visually amplify the macrophonic assemblage that we call the world. Illuminates a certain problematic of lessons in which how and where he pursues this deep, rigorous, advanced learning is all bound up with what he passes on to those who are willing to attend. The capacity to discover and invent things, which is to say things of beauty, is not only something with which Mr Dial is richly endowed but is also one of his fundamental and enduring themes. He is concerned with material and sensual emergences of light, flashes of eye, spirit, glimpse, echoes, small cutting acts of speech that cut speech in the interest of its formation and their subsequent fades and traces. Mr Dial's studies of the interplay of the informal and form are evidence of his rigorous training in both. \n\nMr Dial's work bespeaks a whole other ecology of things. Of their abundance in the refusal of whatever notion of the disposable — this is another essential theme of and in his work. One might speak of the biodiversity of that work, of a kind of uncut, imaginative, generativity that studies generativity. One is tempted to refer to but one must beware the ex nihilo as, Donne understands it, because Mr Dial serially lets us know that there's no such thing as nothing, as the out of nothing, as making something out of nothing, of making a way out of no way. Mr Dial makes things out of things. They are things. There are ways and he is educated in their eloquence. Mr Dial allows and requires us to think the impermanence, the extraordinary Evanescence and ephemerality of the non-disposable, of that which was not made of nothing. A divinity that now must be understood as common. That his works may someday disappear or fall apart not into nothing but rather into the informal, deformed, informing some things that they were. Which is to say into the general condition of possibility that we call the lifecycle. The recycle exists for me as a massive incalculable source of comfort. In these works the richness of the informal is given to but not suppressed by form. Someday, someone will make something out of the fragments of something Mr Dial made. What will be made then?. What will be made again?. What will be remade again and again?. Is where and when some thing will emerge as the anarchic principle of creativity. \n\nWhat I've been trying to say is that in order to begin to consider the question of where Mr Dial is coming from you have to be able to assume that he comes from somewhere and to consider that where he comes from is not only a place to be studied — a place it has been studied — but that it is a place of study. A place where people are engaged in study, immersed in the articulation of a poetics of study. Pipe Shop, as McDowell luminously remembers it — Professor McDowell I should say — luminously remembers it, is an Institute for Advanced Study. In Mr Dial’s serial reconstruction of it we come to know Pipe Shop is something both left and born. Deconstructed and reborn. To say that Mr Dial makes things is also to say that he makes studies. Mr Dial studies intensely, massively, passionately. He studies, his works are studies of and in an alternative ecology that challenges a traditional conception of the work. They are life studies of and in the life cycle that move against the grain of Marx's own fantasies of human mastery over nature. Independent of the question of whether they will or can be preserved is the question of what they preserve. Precisely in the relatively immediate question of their decomposition and in their own corporation of the fact and question of decomposition. They preserve by way of their eruptive recombinant force, the ontological totality.",

First, I started using materials I was familiar with from printmaking, like an installation would be made of paper, wood, and metal. I became fascinated with found materials.\n\nFirst of all, from a financial standpoint I had no money. Second, you could go to the junkyard and buy materials by the pound. The functions of these materials fascinated me. They were made by other hands for other purposes and at other times, and then they were discarded as being useless. So the idea that they could be rejuvenated and repurposed was exciting, because it taught me how to identity those things that had potential for something. Certain things had to identity themselves. This process of identification, the period of gestation in the studio, and lastly, the period of transformation is the way I started working sculpturally. I stumbled into it rather obtusely and never from a traditional standpoint of technical skill but more from a standpoint of being able to assemble things and bring things together as vehicles of subtle force as much as something to look at and experience. So I tried to make these material things as immediate and ethereal as music. And the music I pursued, I tried to make it as visceral and physical—almost approaching matter. Trying to make both of the things do what they naturally are not inclined to do was a challenge.",

Sonny Rollins: Yes it would. Very definitely. Jim Hall: Will that work back, then as a feedback to you?. Sonny Rollins: Very definitely. We get ideas as we go along. Even though we might play the same song, we might put a little inflection here, inflection there which we might pick up from the other guys in the group. This would change the whole color so to speak of the song. Of course, this makes it very nice to play because it’s a different experience each time. Jim Hall: But you still have little places where you still do the same kinds of things at various points in a performance, do ya?. Sonny Rollins: Yes. Definitely. We have places where we mark. I guess they could be called landmarks along the way. Of course, this discipline allows enables us to be free. And to do things freely.",

It’s heartbreaking to think the difference its survival might have made.” Recently, in the context of questions over Confederate monuments, there have been calls to recreate Savage’s “The Harp” and display it at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. Savage viewed her own legacy with humility, putting the emphasis on the success of her students. In a 1935 interview in Metropolitan Magazine, she said, “I have created nothing really beautiful, really lasting, but if I can inspire one of these youngsters to develop the talent I know they possess, then my monument will be in their work.”",

      "content": "The things sort of organize themselves naturally. One of my friends said in an interview recently that fundamentally what he’s trying to do is to put things in an affective proximity to one another, and I think that really crystallizes it. When you are talking about a mediated thing, a picture or representational image, it’s not “for real.” It always functions in this space of a sign or signifier. These things tend to resonate in a specific way, but what happens is when you place a resonant artifact next to another resonant object, they create a new harmonic. So at a certain point I had a set of images that resonated in response to one another. And like a strand of pearls, I just laid them out. Then I watched it and said, “Oh, this is kind of interesting,” and made a few adjustments. \n\nI have a very simple mantra and it’s this: I want to make black cinema with the power, beauty, and alienation of black music. That’s my big goal. The larger preoccupation is how do we force cinema to respond to the existential, political, and spiritual dimensions of who we are as a people. Music to me is a convenient marker of that. Music is the one space in which we [as black people] know we have totally actualized ourselves; even though we keep inventing shit we don’t ever have to write another song to contribute as magnificently as we already have. So a cinema like the music—that’s what Love Is the Message is trying to do.\n\nThe problem with black cinema in it’s current form is on the one hand it is the only game in town; it’s a very structured set-up and it’s not conducive to get at the kinds of things I’m trying to portray using the cinematic apparatus to show black sociality and how it functions. Shit on Worldstar Hip Hop is way more interesting than 99.9 percent of the bullshit black filmmakers in Hollywood are doing. To me, not every black filmmaker who is making black films is trying to make black cinema. \nThe thing that’s great about Aretha Franklin, when you hear her, is not just her individual genius, but that she is working in a form that evolved from the expressions, desires, and pressures of what it means to be black. Part of it is just trying to get people to see these things—the footage is everywhere.",

      "content": "Oh that's so interesting because in thinking back to the question of what does it mean to suffer and what does it mean for Black people to suffer when suffering is the ground? Who makes meaning of suffering? It's who makes meaning of it, for whom the suffering is performed and this comes back to the question that you asked before in relation to the non-Black desire, or we could say white desire to consume the spectacle of Black death. That my suffering is supposed to mean something, it's supposed to be educative somehow. But it's not educative for me. It simply is. And so how do we theorize, how do we contend with that is-ness. In those ways I found Afropessimism extremely useful and when I first found Jared and Frank's work I thought, here are two other people who take seriously the ontology of Black suffering. I'd been searching for this other than Saidiya and Spillers. And at the same time I'm not at all wedded to psychoanalytic thought, I use the tools that help me try to think through what I'm trying to think through which is always centered on Black being or Black non-being. And so in In the Wake: on Blackness and Being I've been thinking about the hold and the wake and the ship and the weather as I try to think through what Rinaldo Walcott calls \"black life forms,\" and questions of their continuing in the wake. And in thinking about the Zong I've also been trying to work some with the science of wakes. If something or someone is thrown or jumped overboard or if someone drowns and their body is not recovered that body won't last long in the water. And you will most likely not recover the bones. A colleague who teaches fluid dynamics told me about residence time, which is the amount of time that the nutrients exist in the water.  So I've been thinking about residence time, those Africans thrown, jumped overboard who, as their bodies broke down into various components, like sodium from their blood, are with us still in residence time. I've been trying to think through those things in terms of how we understand the conditions and duration of Black suffering. \n\nLet me reprise what I say about wakes from the piece in The Black Scholar—wakes are processes. Through them we think about the dead and about our relations to them. They're rituals through which to enact grief and memory. They allow those among the living to mourn the passing of the dead through ritual. They include the watching of relatives and friends beside the body of someone who is dying and the deceased from the passage to death to burial and then afterwards whatever feasting drinking or other kinds of observances take place. They're often religious observances but they also can be secular ones. Also, wakes are the track left on the water surface by a ship, the disturbance caused by a body swimming or one that's moved in water or in air. They're the currents behind a body in flight, \"a disturbed flow\" it's what's in the line of sight of an observed object, it's also something that's in the line of recoil of a gun. And also wake means something like being awake and consciousness. So I've been thinking a lot about wakes, on a personal and larger Black global diaspora level. And that brought me to what I am trying to articulate as a theory and praxis of the wake and wake work. A praxis, a theorization, and a performance of the wake and wake-work, about how we think and live in the unlivable in the wake of slavery. We walk into these unlivable lives and we're faced with what are supposed to be, as far as the larger society is concerned, ungrievable deaths. And so thinking about grieving the ungrievable, living in—wresting something from the unlivable—is some kind of wake work. I'm thinking too of the ways that the call seems always to be about death. We're called into action by death and I'm thinking of the call—the call on the phone, that dreaded late night, or early morning, or mid-afternoon—it doesn't really matter what time—call that you know is somehow about death. And the ways we are both animated and also made inanimate by it. We are brought into some kind of action at the same time that it is another deadening blow. We continually respond to those grievous conditions of Black life that abut Black death. Black life that isn't life, not life as and for those who determine life. Not the human with a capital H. I am thinking about how we recognize imminence and immanence (imminence with an I and immanence with an A) so that imminence with an I is something that's about to occur and immanence with an A is something's inherent, it remains within, so the imminence and immanence of Black death. I'm trying to think carefully about how to say this, but I also want to think about all those ways in which subjectification only confers violence—that violence precedes and exceeds the Black—that absolutely useful framing of Frank's. But I also want to think about what exceeds that hold, even as we recognize Blackness as ontology, as structural position, something is in excess of that that does not mean that that something exceeds deathliness, but that one might imagine otherwise even as one sees and recognizes captivity. So how might we think about that? In some ways, that's the intramural.",

I mean some of you are coming from a Celtic background, and you’re probably using African rhythms in what you’re doing. My genetic background is West African, Celtic, and First Nations. My grandmother is First Nations. I have all kinds of Celtic great grandmothers that I got pictures of them and whatever. Then West African, right? Your genetics... I’m going off here, but you know you think you look like X, Y, and Z, but you have no idea what’s in your bloodlines, and what starts calling you not only what you’re hearing in the environment, but what’s actually coming from your bloodlines.\nThe first time I heard bagpipes, I was 19 years old. I was at McGill doing music, and I raced in the... The Black Watch went by. I never heard pipes in my entire life. I ran to the window and burst into tears. I just... I almost just passed out. It was so amazing what I was listening to. It just hit such a deep cord. Now, that’s true of the pipes anyway. But unbeknownst to me, I have Celtic grandmothers, right? Well they’re speaking to me. Just like my African ones were, and my grandfathers, right? The same as first... When my grandmother... My father’s mother is First Nations, right? I never saw her dance any other way except the way indigenous people in this planet... Planet. Indigenous people on this land dance. The rest of us all had our asses stuck out and we were African [gets up and dances with ass out] Right? That’s the African... If you draw lines based on what people, what their culture is, the African stance is with the forward and the ass out, right? Right. [makes stance] No, that’s traditional, right? That’s what I did, right? My grandmother danced like this [dances casually] Right? She’s married to an African man. She was dancing like this, right? I was too young to know what that was until many years later I came to understand. She’s Cherokee, and she’d gone to Cherokee schools, and she had a Cherokee mother. Yeah, that’s... All of that. We’re all of that. \nThis is going to really weird places, isn’t it? [laughter] Anyway, you are all of that, right? All of you. It doesn’t matter what color your skin may be, or who, whatever. If you do DNA testing, you will find the world is in your bodies, right? The world is calling to you. That’s why your generation is the generation that is going to save this world because you are all world citizens. Yeah. You are. Even though you may not know it on a conscious way, that’s how you act. I have to tell you I’m so happy to have lived long enough to meet you all because you’re the generation that was promised a long time ago. Years, and years, and years ago I heard about your generation coming, but they always say something is coming, but they never say when, right? For the longest time I was looking. Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? I’m looking at Generation X. This can’t be them, right? This is not what was promised. [laughter] This is the bi-generation, right? Whatever. But you all finally showed up. Now you’re here and I’m just totally honored to have lived long enough to meet you all.\nI don’t remember. Let me think, now. Oh, I remember. OK. There was a studio up in the middle of nowhere and they wanted to, I had the money to be able to, which is an amazing experience to actually have the money to be able to go into a studio. But I did. So I took it to this little studio in the middle of nowhere and we recorded it and then we put it out on a tiny little cassette, because that’s what we had. We sold maybe 100 copies of it. Then it went dormant for 100 years. Then the princess came along and kissed me, or whatever, you all don’t know that story, do you. You know how the prince always comes along and kisses the princess and then she wakes up from a sleep of 100 years? Whatever. \nAnyway, so the prince, or the princess, whatever, came along and kissed this little album and a Japanese man found this album as a cassette and about a year and a half ago, he found it, and I had lots of copies because nobody bought it. He said, “Can I have 30 copies?” So I shipped them to Japan and then a week later, he said, “I’ve sold them all out, can I have 30 more?” And I shipped them to Japan. Two weeks later he said, “I’ve sold them all out.” But unbeknownst to me, he was internationally connected. The next thing I knew, I had about 10 record companies after me. After silence for 50 years. Interesting, isn’t it?\nIt’s all about time. You don’t know what the timing for anything is. We don’t know the timing of our death, we don’t know the timing of our children, they’re going to appear to us, we don’t know the timing of when the perfect mate comes along or several perfect mates. We really don’t know anything. We think we do, but there’s an overarching... Our lives... There’s purpose to each life and what that purpose is is not necessarily revealed immediately.\nFor some people it’s revealed very early. For some people, it’s revealed again and again as they go along. For me, that purpose has only recently been revealed. I can tell you what it is. My purpose, who knew, was to encourage your generation about the fact that you all are going to change the world and hopefully save us. Because it’s your generation that went ape over this album. Why, I have no idea. I was writing this before you were born, most of you. Timing.\nWhat’s his name, the greatest French impressionist, Van Gogh. You’re familiar with Van Gogh, yes? Van Gogh sold one painting in his entire lifetime. He went completely mad and killed himself ultimately. One painting he sold in his entire lifetime. When I was about 40 years old, I heard a radio newscast saying that one of his paintings had just sold for $40 million. $40 million. And he couldn’t sell but one in his lifetime. Of course, he was overcome by that and he killed himself. But timing, we have no idea, I’m not Van Gogh, so this is not going to be happening for me 40,000 years after I’m dead like it will be for Van Gogh. Well, maybe not 40,000 years.\nBut we each have a purpose. There is something that each of us here is called to do. We don’t know what it is. Do it. Just do what you’re called to do because at some point or another, what you’re called to do will be exactly what is wanted. It may be next week or it may be 25 years from now, but do it.\nThat was the lesson for me. I didn’t get discouraged because I have a Buddhist practice, which for me, I’ve been a Buddhist for 44 years. It’s a daily practice. It helped me to stay very centered and very positive and all of those things that you need to be able to negotiate this world, which is busy crumbling as we speak. It helped me to be able to negotiate it. You are inheriting a world that is in much, much more pain than the world I inherited. I am sorry that my generation really, really did not do hardly anything to stop that even though years and years and years and years ago many of us were trying. But by and large, my generation was deaf to it all. They were just so happy to have made it through World War II that they just went on a buying spree. Everything was about buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. What can I get? What can I have that makes me feel secure?\nWell, those days are over. And what you are all doing, what you give, art is... Art is the forward aspect of our humanity. It is what’s right out there of our humanity, of our hearts. And that’s what you all have now to give going forward. I will be dead, but you will be doing that. Do not fail to give your hearts. Do not fail. It’s so important. I’m going to be watching you all from another dimension. OK? Yeah. I’m so grateful. I’m saying this again. I am so grateful you have appeared.\nDid I answer your question? Or did I go off on one of my things?\nOK. I don’t consider that I write music, OK? And most all of my friends are artists of one discipline or another, and they all say the same thing. For me, what I am is that I came in with a set of sensitivities, and I honed those sensitivities by studying as much music as I could, and listening to as much music as I could, and I’m kind of like a radio, right? And I’m tuned to certain frequencies, because I honed those frequencies. And the universe sends me stuff on those frequencies. It sends stuff all the time depending on what frequency you’re honed to. The universe is the creative force, period and amen, and we are all just aspects of it. So there’s music coming through all the time, there’s painting coming through all the time, there’s mathematics coming through all the time. There’s all of these things coming through, ‘cause they’re all creative. Doesn’t matter what you call it, but it’s all about creation. There’s stuff coming through all the time, and if you really tune yourself and work hard to be able to hear what’s coming through, in this case, or see what’s coming through, if you’re a visual artist or whatever that’s meant for you, specifically, then there is no end to what is coming through.\nAnd you can say no, on a given day, “No today, I’m not open for translating,” or whatever you want to call it. Doesn’t matter. It’ll go to somebody else. I can tell you so many stories of things that were meant to happen, people who had ideas and then they didn’t say yes to the idea, and one year later, that identical idea appears to somebody else who they get to know, and it’s the same thing. It’s because that idea was coming through, and that person said no, and that’s okay, and it went to the next person. So that’s how I think of it, and I’m going to say this in a certain kind of way, and I don’t mean to be insulting, but I’m kind of like an idiot savant, and the reason I say that is this. When I hear whatever it is that’s coming through, it is so powerful, and I write it down as fast as I can, or I translate it as fast as I can, and then, when it’s all down, I look at it, I haven’t an idea in the world how to play it. It’s like I have no concept where this came from, I can barely translate it, and I went to McGill, for music, and I learned how to write down stuff. I am a trained classical musician, and still, I can’t, barely, play it when it comes through, once it’s finished. And that’s because it didn’t really originate from me. That’s a really important point.\nNow, you may not believe that, and that’s okay, but when you get to my age, you might believe it, if we’re all so lucky as to have you all be able to live into your 70s or your 80s, because it is nothing short of a miracle, a creative miracle that is happening every split instant that is coming to you. And that might be just what you make for dinner, because it’s the same thing, right? It’s the same principle. Yeah. I don’t want to get religious, because it’s not about religion, but it’s a spiritual reality. It’s a wholly thing, W-H-O-L-L-Y thing, right? Yeah. OK, yeah. Does that answer your question?",

      "content": "In a rather cosmic guidance, an inner voice very clearly suggested that I swap the guitar for the autoharp in the window. I left the store with it, not knowing what I was going to do. But when I got home, I was inspired to explore tuning my favorite guitar open tunings into the autoharp. That gave me a new instrument with which to hang out with in meditative, contemplative mode. I could go into a trance; I could go into mediation, and just explore without being concerned about right or wrong because once I tuned it open, the whole string board was like a string drum I could just freely improvise on and experiment with.\n\nWell, about a month or two before I was guided to obtain the auto-harp, I had a mystical sound vision during a meditation session that revealed a non-linear, or an otherworldly, music-hearing experience. It altered my sense of the direction I wanted to go with music. This music that I heard, or am hearing, fills up all space and speaks through the conscious awareness to allow it to know that eternity is now — the eternal present time. It also speaks through consciousness to allow it to directly perceive the unity of the entire omniverse, that everything is taking place right now.\nThat experience might have lasted five or 10 minutes during a pre-meditation session in Queens. I couldn’t write the music down or record it because it wasn’t happening in the physical dimension. But I did some research on it and discovered that there’s this non-linear music that one can become aware of in heightened states of inner awareness. So that music gave me a sense of direction of where to go with music. And it took me a little while after being with the zither to make the connection that the zither was the instrument I was guided to in order to reference that visionary sound experience.\n Yeah — to achieve an immersionary trance state. That’s what the experience did; it taught me sound’s ability to take one into an immerisonary trance state. So that was my new direction in music — to use music to direct listeners into an immersionary trance state.\nI don’t believe I can replicate that music, but it gave me a sensation of a space and time — a presence I wasn’t aware of at the time. I was more aware of the third and fourth dimension — the physical dimension. This experience gave me a direct experience of a higher dimension. I don’t know if it’s appropriate to call it the fifth dimension or a transcendental dimension, but after becoming aware of that space and that timelessness, I felt I was qualified to improvise music in reference to this alternative space. I’m hearing and feeling the space, and I’m relating to it; I point to it through the music I am playing.\nAlthough the music I am playing is not replicating that music that I heard, it is representing my emotional and psychological experience of the space that was revealed to me through that music. That space is always everywhere, all pervading. That was my experience; I was guided to have an experience of space and time that was not immediately available through regular external consciousness.\nAnyway, I set my zither on top of the case, and I strummed it for maybe a minute, until I thought I should check on the cat, in case it’s not breathing. And after that strumming, I opened the case, and the cat stood up and looked with his big eyes, as if he was questioning all of reality. He slowly stepped out of the zither case, and moved around the room very quietly, mystified. And after that moment, that cat never dug its claws into anyone’s feet.\nI checked back with this lady a month later to ask if the cat’s demeanor had permanently shifted and she said, ‘Yes, I don’t know what happened.’ That taught me the power of immersion; this cat was immersed in a black container, so its sense of boundaries were probably annihilated temporarily. It was just a state of consciousness merged into a sound ocean. And after that experience, I think the cat came forward with an expanded sense of its identity through the sound. That taught me the transformative power of an immersionary sound hearing experience.",

      "content": "When someone says to you “body,” what comes to mind? I’ve lectured at different institutions, and it’s always interesting to see how they are or are not defining what a body is. When I’m at the London School of Economics there is one definition, but then you go over to an art space and it’s a whole different kettle of fish. No one comes up with the same idea. So many people bring very real and devastating bias into shaping this “body” and shaping how it should work, who it should serve.\n\nWhat the book is arguing is that the body is a construct. There are so many different versions of what a body is, and part of the violence we are seeing in this moment right now, especially as tied to Black lives, to trans lives, connects to this notion of who does and does not fit and who is and is not defined or read as human, quite literally. Those decisions are actually a determining factor for making decisions about who has the right to live.\n\nThe questions about “essential worker” have become part of this COVID-19 conversation, which is urgent and very important. When you go into Whole Foods, for example, you’re seeing a Black and Brown workforce shopping for groceries for people who are sitting at home. This is plantation capitalism. With Amazon, there’s this notion of it as a faceless force that is too big to break—but who are the physical individuals inside of those warehouses? Those are the people who are putting themselves at risk on a daily basis. These, too, are essential workers.\n\nThe challenge is that those individuals have always been there, but not seen. The workforces that are often carrying the burden of these great moments of historical crisis, social and cultural, are Black and Brown people. They are taking care of your grandmother at the hospital. They are the people who are delivering your groceries. And those are individuals who are rendered invisible by the broader systems of capitalism and economy that exist in America and the world today.\n\nSo I think it’s complicated. This notion of “anti-body” is not intended to erase; it’s about raising the question of who is and is not visible, challenging people to think about what their definitions are. It’s about recognizing that the term “body” as entangled with a discussion of what is and is not “human,” is gendered, and racialized—and too often it is Black bodies, femme bodies, queer bodies that are rendered invisible by machinic systems.",

My focus will center on enslaved people who liberated themselves from bondage in the Great Dismal Swamp borderlands area of Virginia and North Carolina. Throughout this talk I will discuss how geospatial analysis has broadened the ways I approach enslaved movement in cartographies of struggle by pointing out the literal and figurative connections to space that enslaved people recognized in their journeys toward making freedom. The human costs associated with running away like distance, navigational literacy, and access to shelter and food are all weighed in this conversation. Ultimately the goal of this talk is to expand our understanding of how geospatial processes intervene with investigations into slavery and freedom and inform how enslaved movement translates spaces of the past.",

      "content": "Today I'm going to read the first page and a half of Toni Morrison’s Sula. I read this book back in some summer, during some summer in high school. And it was, I believe, the first book by Toni Morrison that I've read. And I remembered really vividly the relationship between Sula and Nell, two of the main characters, but I didn't remember it wasn't until I really started with my studies of black places and black towns that I circled back to this book and realize that the place in which Sula and Nell lived was one of these black places that I was writing about. So, I'm just going to read—and it's also an environmental justice, like, there's an environmental justice component to this as well that I think is really important and a really important element of some of the work that I do. So, this is from part one of Sula.\n\nIn that place, where they tore the nightshade and blackberry patches from their roots to make room for the Medallion City Golf Course, there was once a neighborhood. It stood in the hills above the valley town of Medallion and spread all the way to the river. It is called the suburbs now, but when black people lived there it was called the Bottom. One road, shaded by beeches, oaks, maples and chestnuts, connected it to the valley. The beeches are gone now, and so are the pear trees where children sat and yelled down through the blossoms to passersby. Generous funds have been allotted to level the stripped and faded buildings that clutter the road from Medallion up to the golf course. They are going to raze the Time and a Half Pool Hall, where feet in long tan shoes once pointed down from chair rungs. A steel ball will knock to dust Irene's Palace of Cosmetology, where women used to lean their heads back on sink trays and doze while Irene lathered Nu Nile into their hair. Men in khaki work clothes will pry loose the slats of Reba's Grill, where the owner cooked in her hat because she couldn't remember the ingredients without it.\nThere will be nothing left of the Bottom (the footbridge that crossed the river is already gone), but perhaps it is just as well, since it wasn't a town anyway: just a neighborhood where on quiet days people in valley houses could hear singing sometimes, banjos sometimes, and, if a valley man happened to have business up in those hills--collecting rent or insurance payments--he might see a dark woman in a flowered dress doing a bit of cakewalk, a bit of black bottom, a bit of \"messing around\" to the lively notes of a mouth organ. Her bare feet would raise the saffron dust that floated down on the coveralls and bunion-split shoes of the man breathing music in and out of his harmonica. The black people watching her would laugh and rub their knees, and it would be easy for the valley man to hear the laughter and not notice the adult pain that rested somewhere under the eyelids, somewhere under their head rags and soft felt hats, somewhere in the palm of the hand, somewhere behind the frayed lapels, somewhere in the sinew's curve, He'd have to stand in the back of Greater Saint Matthew's and let the tenor's voice dress him in silk, or touch the hands of the spoon carvers (who had not worked in eight years) and let the fingers that danced on wood kiss his skin. Otherwise the pain would escape him even though the laughter was part of the pain.\nA lot of the writing about them tends to be about the past, intends to discuss those places as though they no longer exist—discusses them as though they're dead. And so, yeah, so, my aim is really to kind of not only stop the autopsy, I guess, in a sense, but to think about what we can actually learn from these places about what it means to make a place and what it means to make a community. It’s a patchwork of places that have very different political views and have very different images of what the future, our imaginations of what the future of rural places should be and their place in our national conversation.",

Because you see so many of our ancestors was killed because we never have accepted slavery.  We’ve had to live under it, but we never wanted it.  So we know that this flag is drenched with our blood.

There is a very low value placed upon Black women’s psyches in this society, which is both racist and sexist. As an early group member once said, “We are all damaged people merely by virtue of being Black women.” We are dispossessed psychologically and on every other level, and yet we feel the necessity to struggle to change the condition of all Black women. In “A Black Feminist’s Search for Sisterhood,” Michele Wallace arrives at this conclusion:\nWe exists as women who are Black who are feminists, each stranded for the moment, working independently because there is not yet an environment in this society remotely congenial to our struggle—because, being on the bottom, we would have to do what no one else has done: we would have to fight the world. \n\nWallace is pessimistic but realistic in her assessment of Black feminists’ position, particularly in her allusion to the nearly classic isolation most of us face. We might use our position at the bottom, however, to make a clear leap into revolutionary action. If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression.",

I am fine but feel now pressed to do even more after this last attempt at silencing me came so close.\n\nI became aware of you, Miss Carson, hearing your voice ring strong through the articles I’ve come across in various magazines. Although I am not a bird-watcher or naturalist, your passion for doing right by God’s creation—birds and humanity both—strikes me as righteous in every sense of the word. Considering how grave is the need to enlarge the just message of charity and care to every living soul in these urgent times we find ourselves in, I felt compelled to reach out.\n\nI’m inquiring to find out if you might be willing to travel south to join me at a wondrous place deep down in the South Carolina Low Country. This place, the Penn Center, is in the heart of history both bitter and sweet. Bitter because the Low Country was at the center of so much pain and misery for the Gullah people—those closest in heritage and blood to West Africa, who were kidnapped and enslaved for the purpose of growing this nation, by cotton bale and rice crop, into the power that it has become. The sweetness lies in the fact that this place where so much pain was enacted became, early in the Civil War, a kind of freedmen’s refuge, as liberty came earliest where in many ways bondage had been harshest. This Penn Center, which developed into a novel community of Negro self-sufficiency with schools, farming, and the infrastructure necessary for those loosed from shackles to thrive unfettered, was radical in origin, and I believe it will become a great progressive reservoir for our thinking about how best to free all people—Black, White, Brown, Red, and otherwise—and thus hold this nation to the promises it has made. It is in a far corner of an expanse of wildness—salt marsh, forest, and sea—that makes it mostly inaccessible to all but the native Gullah people and the few white folks living, fishing, or hunting there. In that way, it will be a safe place for respite and reflection. I can promise solitude and little interference from the public and press.\n\nI’m thinking, Miss Carson, that we might convene in Charleston or Savannah (whichever is most convenient to you but also draws the least attention from reporters and those set against us) and then drive out to the Penn Center on the marsh. I know you will appreciate the vistas of so much wild on the commute. I imagine there will be birds in abundance to hold your attention. We can talk en route. There is a great chance that a young man named John Lewis from Alabama will be there. He preaches to chickens, I hear, and so the two of you will have feathers in common. A couple of the team members, Ralph or Jesse, might join us on the marsh walks, but they’ve already complained of the mosquitoes they’ll encounter and so will likely stay behind. As I’ve said, I’m no bird-watcher, but I’m hoping that if there are sparrows to be observed, perhaps you might watch them, too, and be able to even tell me what—or who—they are. If God sees fit to watch them, perhaps I should pay more attention too.\n\nI’m hoping that we might congenially discuss what I trust will be our shared mission to make this world better for all beings—for every living thing. Our singing birds. Our fight for civil rights. I know that you may have had your fill of all things political. I’m asking not that you commit to marches or more congressional hearings but, rather, to brainstorm with me on how to expand this movement and enlarge the one that I believe you’ve set fire to. Thinking on it, I find it hard to see how one can love the earth but not fellow human beings. And also, it seems incongruous that one could love humanity and exact sins of degradation against nature. I think we’d be closer to getting this act passed with more pressure and some political will, which might happen if we could stretch the concept of civil rights to the very air we breathe—the air we share with your beloved birds.",

We call them masseurs now because it’s more dignified  and sounds better, but we called them rubbers.  My work with oils,  I felt that we did not know enough about  the efficacy of oils in the art of healing,  so I started out to find as far as possible  the value of some of these oils.  So that in using these oils and liniments and pastes  and powders and so forth,  there seemed to be something lacking.  When I came to Tuskegee,  I had a chance of studying it further. \n\nWe have to be very careful, lest the ego comes in.  A person that can bake a reasonably good cake  or a reasonably good pan of biscuit can’t go out  and put up a shingle and say that they are good cooks!  But they simply use their kettle or pan  as a means to carry out the end.  So I simply use the chemical laboratory to find  certain things that I’m looking for.  A laboratory is simply a place  where we tear things to pieces.  Sometimes we can get them together again  if we want to put them together, and sometimes we can’t.  But nevertheless, we can pull things to pieces  and get the truth that we are searching for.  We can at least find out,  out of what certain things are made,  which gives us information to do other things with.  Sometimes it is wise  not to look for too much appreciation.  The main thing is to be sure you’re right, and go ahead,  regardless of whether people appreciate it  or whether they don’t, because in time,  they will appreciate it.  So simply be sure that you are on the right road.  \n\nWell, that is a question that can’t very well be answered  by yes and no.  I should say the chief purpose of scientific training  is to find truth.  And whenever you find truth, you find the science.  You shall know truth and the truth shall make you free.  There is nothing more destructive to development  than ignorance and ignorance is simply, I don’t know.  I should say this that the further anyone  gets away from themselves,  the greater will be their success in life.  You can’t get very far in life  if you don’t get away from self.  You know self is a little bit of a thing.  That little word I, terrible I disease,  one of the worst I diseases that was ever known.  (piano music)  Then too, the question naturally comes in,  how can I be sure that I’m on the right road.  I should simply say this, that in all thy ways,  acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths.  Now you must learn to look to him for direction  and then follow and you’ll never go wrong.",

Drawing on real-world examples, she shows how TVC creates dynamic learning environments where underrepresented ethnic students feel that they belong. Students who remix computationally, for instance, have larger toolkits of computational skills with which to connect cultural practices to STEAM subjects; reappropriation offers a way to navigate cultural repertoires; improvisation is firmly rooted in cultural and creative practices. Finally, Gaskins explores an equity-oriented approach that makes a distinction between conventional or dominant pedagogical approaches and culturally relevant or responsive making methods and practices.

      "content": "Susie King Taylor (née Baker) was born into slavery on August 6, 1848, at the Grest Plantation in Liberty County in coastal Georgia. Her mother was a domestic servant. By age seven, Taylor was allowed to move to Savannah, Georgia, to live with her grandmother, Dolly. Most of her childhood was spent with two of her eight siblings and with Grandmother Dolly, who encouraged Taylor to learn to read and write. At this time, Georgia had severe restrictions on education for freed and enslaved African Americans. Clandestine schooling was the only way an African American child could get an education in the Antebellum South. Taylor’s grandmother arranged for her to attend two secret schools taught by free African American women and family friends. Born into slavery in the Deep South, she served the Union Army in various capacities: officially as a \"laundress\" but in reality a nurse, caretaker, educator, and friend to the First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry (later the 33rd U.S. Colored Troops Infantry Regiment). In 1902, she published these experiences in Reminiscences of My Life in Camp, a Civil War memoir told from the singular perspective of an African American woman. Her work during the Civil War certainly included washing clothes, but also extended into the realm of gun maintenance, nursing, and education—positions befitting her experience as a schoolteacher. At just 14 years of age, Taylor had become the first African American known to teach at a freedman’s school in Georgia. In a 1902 letter republished in Reminiscences (p. xiii), Colonel Trowbridge apologized for the \"technicality\" of Taylor's identification as only a laundress, rather than a nurse. Such a \"technicality\" led to her never receiving pay or a pension. While Taylor's contributions to the war are nothing short of incredible, her story is often overlooked within Civil War history.",

Annette Richter is the great-great-granddaughter of Annetta M. Lane, the enslaved woman who founded this order in 1867. I am not sure if you have ever been graciously but firmly pushed out of line by elegantly dressed black senior citizens, but I can tell you the experience is nothing short of affirming. \"Excuse me, dear.\" \"Darling, could I just?\" they say, and Annette is surrounded, and I realize my chance to talk with her will have to come another day. This is a moment that exemplifies the spirit of the Tents. It is an organization made up of dozens of chapters all over the South and Northeast, with hundreds of members currently. It was founded on the ideals of freedom, independence, and self-autonomy, but it is also firmly rooted in the practical. The Tents is a massively successful, wonderfully efficient community self-help organization that has operated without outside help for over 150 years. But because it is run by and for black women — black churchwomen — it is largely unknown and in fact was deliberately kept secret for much of its existence. Annetta M. Lane and Harriet R. Taylor, two black women from Virginia, founded this order in 1867. Annetta was enslaved in Virginia and, according to her family's history, was a nurse on her plantation. This role meant that she moved both among the white enslavers in the main house and among the black people the family enslaved in the fields. Such a role meant she was valuable to the white slavers, and it also meant she could transmit information and care to those enslaved. The sermon ends with this litany of prayer: \"Pray until domestic violence ends. Pray until there's liberty and justice for all. Pray until there is a cure for all cancers. Pray until racism ends. Pray until there is health care for the whole universe. Pray until we're all together as one.",

It's a combination of different sounds. See this IN means an instrument file. That's a combination of the VC’s, the VC means voice file. The way to find out what Ritmo is, you highlight it. Then touch query. Query will tell you what’s in it. That breaks it down. Right, I love it. That's beautiful. I remember you showed me this in the truck, remember? Page down, we’re going to look at the library.  And there’s two ways to do it. You can either write it on the screen or you can play it on the keyboard. You see? If you write in on the screen [beat is playing].  I don’t know which keyboard that is. Beautiful. \n\nThe funk will prevail. Right, it's interesting cuz these instruments were designed for people to use. For people use, right? You know it's just a tool, another tool. The way an axe is a tool. An axe can be a tool to cut wood to build a house or can be a tool to slaughter your neighbor. A synthesizer can be a tool to really hurt people's ears and interfere with their lives or it can be a tool to make a really nice sounding instrument that can really affect people in a positive way. It all depends on the person that is using it. People blame machines very often. It’s the machine’s fault. How could it be the machine’s fault? We have to plug it in. The machine doesn’t do anything but sit there until we plug it in. It doesn’t plug itself in. It don’t program itself, yet. It’s on the way, though. You know, we have to make the programs, we have to learn how to utilize them to make them sound the way we want them to sound. So this is why Quincy and I can get together and no matter what kind of instrumental sounds we have, we use them according to what we feel.

We’ve been here since the beginning of time; the earliest record of our role in women’s advocacy dates back to 1866 when Frances Thompson, a formerly enslaved, disabled, Black trans woman, became a trailblazer in the fight to end sexual violence against women. Thompson’s courage to sound off on rape culture was radical and revolutionary for her time. For centuries, not even white women were protected by rape laws. Only their husbands or male relatives could report the rape and demand compensation as victims of “property damage.” Imagine what it must have been like to have the perpetrator be your father or husband? On paper, marital rape didn’t become illegal in the United States until 1976. Black women in the 1800s certainly weren’t positioned to charge white men with rape as they were considered chattel, and their masters were permitted under the law to do as they pleased. Not only was Thompson, a disabled Black trans woman, one of the first Black people in American history to testify before Congress, she was also one of the first women and the first trans person to do so.",

History and experiences, emotion and knowledge travel across time and back again, linking the artist and viewers of her work with generations of people who came before them. This is made explicit in her commitment to certain themes, imagery, and objects, and her continual reinvention of them over decades. “I can no longer separate the work by saying this deals with the occult and this deals with shamanism or this deals with so and so…. It’s all together and it’s just my work,” she said in 1989. The artist has also repeatedly turned to her family and their history as sources for her work. “Keep for Old Memiors” (1976) includes fragments of letters and photographs saved by the artist’s great aunt Hattie, framed by a pair of women’s gloves that suggest, among other things, the tactility of accessing a physical record of one’s life. The intimacy and scale of Saar’s work encourages a personal connection to the artist and her experience. “To me the trick is to seduce the viewer. If you can get the viewer to look at a work of art, then you might be able to give them some sort of message.” Over the course of her now six-decade career, Saar has continued to make work that honors or critiques the familiar and mines the unknown. “It may not be possible to convey to someone else the mysterious transforming gifts by which dreams, memory, and experience become art. But I like to think that I can try.”",

Cleveland and Franklin excite one another, and soon they sound like duelling Howlin’ Wolves. She closes her eyes and seems happy. In a way, the exercise—filling gospel to the gills with blues sensibility—is a callback to Dorsey, who helped, through “Precious Lord” and many other compositions, to bring the secular sound into the church and start the motion that would culminate, amazingly, in Aretha. Similarly, on the second night, toward the end of the film, she strolls over to the piano—she’s got a mean tomtom of a left hand that gives her playing a jutting edge—and plays “Never Grow Old.” She’s not too far from where her father, the famous preacher C. L. Franklin, sits, flanked by friends. “Never Grow Old” is an old song, but Aretha claims it, making her elders trade expressions of devotion, glee, and terror at her talent, and dismay at the passage of time.

I, too, am a suffragist, because in 2020 many Americans still do not have access to the vote. I grew up hearing about Ida’s willingness to speak up against injustice, inequality and indignity. About her refusal to be silenced, sidelined or marginalized. I heard about the time she wouldn’t go to the “colored car” on the Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad in 1884, and rather than leave the car, for which she had purchased a ticket, she was forced off. She promptly secured an attorney and sued the railroad. I heard about the time when, in 1892, three of her friends were lynched because they owned a grocery store that competed against a white-owned store, and she wrote about it so much in the Memphis Free Speech newspaper that her own life was threatened. She encouraged Black people to use what little power they had to protest, to boycott and ultimately to leave Memphis if they had the means to do so.

But Harriet Tubman fought the institution of slavery well beyond her role as a conductor for the Underground Railroad. As a soldier and spy for the Union Army during the Civil War, Tubman became the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the United States in what is known as the Combahee Ferry Raid. For months, Tubman worked as a laundress, opening a wash house, and serving as a nurse, until she was given orders to form a spy ring. Tubman had proven herself invaluable at gathering clandestine information, forming allies and avoiding capture, as she led the Underground Railroad. In her new role, Tubman assumed leadership of a secret military mission in South Carolina’s low country. As the escapees ran to the shore, Black troops in rowboats transported them to the ships, but chaos ensued in the process. Tubman, who didn’t speak the region’s Gullah dialect, reportedly went on deck and sang a popular song from the abolitionist movement that calmed the group down. He wrote a story without a byline about the “She-Moses” but never mentioned Tubman’s name. He wrote that Montgomery’s “gallant band of 300 soldiers under the guidance of a Black woman, dashed into the enemies’ country, struck a bold and effective blow, destroying millions of dollars worth of commissary store, cotton and lordly dwellings, and striking terror to the heart of the rebeldom brought off bear 800 slaves and thousands of dollars worth of property, without losing a man or receiving a scratch.” Despite the mission’s success, including the recruitment of at least 100 freedmen into the Union Army, Tubman was not compensated for her efforts on the Combahee Ferry Raid. She had petitioned the government several times to be paid for her duties as a soldier. “She was denied because she was a woman,” says Larson.",

The groundwork of abolition was built by Black intersectional feminists who have always also been disabled, survivors, healers, queer and trans. This work does not move forward without respect for this legacy, and it certainly does not progress when we settle for violence that entrenches the very power dynamics we are supposed to abolish. Abolish the police means we confront each other when we fuck up and, from within the margins of society, we build a world where we can all access a livable life.",

On one occasion when she was arrested for selling liquor, she was bailed out by the town’s leading banker, who needed her for his dinner soiree that evening.",

      "content": "That was also a question of mine: What images do I actually like looking at versus making? I spent a lot of time in libraries at RISD and Brown. Part of the plan that I made for myself was—I wish I could articulate my twenty-two, twenty-three-year-old self—to try to look at everything as though it were black. Everything is a black woman. That was the proposition. It was an acceptance of self and an acceptance of these weird limitations that are imposed on this self, my subjectivity—and then to try and look at historical images: at incidents of colonialism, at the formation of the idea of America, of slavery. Different sorts of representations of blackness within all of that—it sort of freed me up to approach everything this way, even though it imposed these very extreme limitations on a point of view. It was that paradox that I really wanted to try and articulate. Not just the history, the images, but also the paradoxical, contradictory mechanics.\n\nBeing exposed to Adrian Piper’s work as an undergrad was significant for me in terms of thinking about how to approach my work. I did a little performance piece on her by way of a paper. I realized that there was a mode of address that I wasn’t considering in my paintings and the mode of address was that the audience, the viewer of a work, has a history and a point of view that directly impacts how work is received. That was important for me to begin to realize. Then there were some artists from the German Expressionist Period: Otto Dix, George Grosz, and a couple of others who I thought were really important when I saw some of their work. It was the rage that was in there and also the attention to details, the subjectivity—they were attentive to their own subjectivity in relation to the world around them. When I started to tackle ideas around race and gender—stories, jokes, and pop culture that inform the way we talk about or fetishize race in this culture—I would say these are influences. But there are counter-influences. People like Betye Saar and the Black Art Movement artists. Considering what limitations some of these artists felt hemmed in by, or the ways they contributed to the strict dogma of the Black Art Movement ideology. I had this cathartic moment when I was still living at home in Atlanta. I was thinking of my role as an artist as being akin to, or being equated with, a kind of colonialist impulse. As an artist you are assumed to be the master of your domain, the master of the canvas, or screen, or whatever. That was kind of comic and problematic for me, painting as “manifest destiny.” I thought there was something ironic in declaring myself the master of this terrain and then asking whatever I put on there to do my bidding. I think that is where I started approaching the master-slave dialectic from my own agency. The problem was being able to accept my own agency. There was a sculptural piece that Betye Saar had done, maybe in 1970, a constructed box, with a Mammy doll holding a broom and a rifle, looking like an ironic play on the subservient versus the militant. My critique of that was that she was still making Mammy do her bidding. (laughter) Mammy was still playing a submissive role relative to the artist. I thought maybe one of the things that would be more likely to happen, although impossible because I’m aware that I am talking about inanimate objects, would be to have them unleashed. To have derogatory figures from history be set loose on the world to do their own thing. They would not necessarily conform or obey my intentions or wishes, or my conceits and concepts. In that regard I think of artists like Mike Kelley, early on when people were thinking about psychology and a relationship to objects. If only I were better at talking theory and psychoanalysis and all of that. I never really fully became that person. I know there is a theory in there around objects and probably a child psychologist like Winnicott who talked about that. I know the names, but I can’t fit it all together in a sentence.\n\nI guess that’s what I don’t know. What are the limitations of the archive? Is it for them or is it for us, for something greater than the sum of its parts? I was thinking a lot about darkness. When you asked earlier about Georgia, and what it was about coming up to Rhode Island and then New York that might have affected my work, that changed my relationship to people, I was telling you about the Atlanta Child Murders and this dark sensation, gothic sensation that overtook me. I was thinking last night further along those lines. I was thinking about that walk to the bus stop when we were still on Decatur, and the apartment complex where we were first living. It had the long, hilly driveway going up into the complex. The lights would always be burned out. If I got up early in the morning to catch the bus to Towers High School, I remember Mom walked me, maybe once or twice, just to the edge of that driveway, and then it was pitch black. You saw the end of the street and it was wooded all around. There must have been a creek running around there. It was the creek and the woods and this total pitch blackness and then road kill— always a possum or something and the stink of death. Road kill and death and that feeling of walking through this dark tunnel surrounded by terrifying dead things just to get up this hill that was populated by people who really didn’t want me around. (laughter) That’s a feeling that sticks with me. I think of that feeling in relation to making things—moving through this dark space to an equally dark space that does not look as threatening.",

      "content": "My work is rooted in my existence as a body with sickle cell zero beta thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder that causes debilitating pain, and bodily deterioration that both increase with age. Being a chronically ill body has shaped my experience into one that is extremely, and highly isolating. The nuances of disability and chronic illness are lost on the average able-bodied individual, and the marginalization, erasure and violence that I have endured from it alone is devastating. In combination with my personal notions of gender, racial and sexual identity, I am fully immersed in otherness. There is so little discussion surrounding this, and little to no exploration of these topics in contemporary work, and I aim to push against that lack of representation. In my practice I am warping concrete, physical forms into highly disembodied abstractions. Through my work I aim to discuss the complexities of living within a body that is highly monitored, constantly examined, and made to feel like a specimen. Taking images that are recognizable as human forms, and reducing them to gestural forms is a juxtaposition of my own bodies objectification, and dissection.\n\nBeing in hospital for as far back as I can remember, my condition has informed my conceptions of body and self. What are the implications of being told you are unhealthy, fragile, and defective from a young age? How does the early and reinforced knowledge of decreased lifespan, and a life of increasingly poor health, pain and bodily deterioration influence the relationship between one and their body? Identity becomes a daunting concept when there is a rift formed between one’s mind, and their body, when the body seemingly functions with a mind of its own, malfunctioning and causing harm. Able-bodied individuals do not realize the supreme privilege in trusting and knowing their own body. Identity as we know it is so highly linked to bodily form, and linked to aspects of bodily existence that are taken for granted. I aim to explore these questions this region of identity, pushing to articulate my own fears, insecurities and confusions around my illness-identity.  My abstracted imaging of my own body is heavily influenced by being so regularly in the hospital, as I am constantly experiencing a very unique form of objectification in which my body is truly treated as a pound of flesh, the vitals that it produces, and the malfunctions it abounds in. In my performance work, I am pushing my own vulnerability and objectification to discuss the realities of mortality and fragility, and the complexities of empowerment in the face of literal powerlessness. \n\nCurrently, I am contemplating the prosthetic, and the simultaneous abstraction and mechanization of the “body.”",

The first is the anthropological and social understanding of   dance as a part of healing, ritual, and entertainment. The second is the   “dance of death”: how martial forms emerged as a response to how societies   have been organized. The third is an appraisal of courtly dance, which has   heavily shaped ballet and modern dance as we understand it today. The final   fork looks at contemporary movement and the intellectual property of dance.   The exhibited works traffic between these forks to shape an alternative  language that suggests how Black moving bodies are regarded. The video will  focus on markings and inscriptions that elaborate individual, collective,   and historiographic schema from stage diagrams to astrological charts. A   series of plant sculptures will feature representations of Black pinups,   whose bodies turning away from the viewer are antithetical to the frontal,   balletic positionality of contemporary dancers. The collage works will   combine images that reference the ghosts of dance’s past, present, and   future—subverting what oppressive structures might term “influence,” but  what others might see as brutal appropriation.",

Nancy’s 46-page diary is filled with lines of determination from what seemed to be her pits of hell while living in Paris. Despite malnutrition, working in no heat, having no benefactor support at times, etc. she kept at her work, kept making, kept soliciting support through her friend WEB DuBois. She kept going. \"Not to be wholly one's self is death to the soul. Poverty, detestable poverty, how you trail behind me ever screeching out your presence. Think you to ever make me a subject of your kingdom? Never! Though I die of hunger I shall never bend the knee to your majesty for I am not of your race. How swiftly the happy days slip by.

I read and feel gratitude and relief that they expressed how something felt or documented certain life events. I’m relieved they found vocabulary to describe scenarios, sensations, moments, and emotions for which even I haven’t been able to match words.

I was not trained in American studies methods, and have been only peripherally involved in American studies programs; nor did I read, until I had to write this speech, any of the traditional American studies texts. I am now and always will be, primarily an African-Americanist. Three years after the uprising in Detroit that whites called a riot and blacks called a rebellion, I became part of the small band of scholars who, in 1970, inaugurated the first Black Studies program at the University of Detroit. Like American studies we were committed to interdisciplinarity: there were four full-time faculty in literature, history, sociology, and religion; the three part-time faculty were in journalism, music, and art. While those in American studies were lighting out for the territory, on the pioneer trail from East to West, Black Studies was following other itineraries: the triangular slave trade, the underground railroad, and the Great Migration, the latter two on a north-south axis leading directly to issues of what José Marti [End Page 1] called, in his claims for hemispheric unity, Nuestra America--\"Our America.\" While American studies scholars were still immersed in Virgin Land, The Machine in the Garden, and Turner's frontier thesis, we were reading Lerone Bennett's Before the Mayflower, Malcolm X's speeches, the essays and stories in Black World, John Hope Franklin's From Slavery To Freedom, and discovering Charles Chesnutt, Gwendolyn Brooks, Chester Himes, James Weldon Johnson, LeRoi Jones, Alice Childress and Frances Harper. In the early 1970s, black scholars in these programs were doing a great deal of recovery work. Many of the texts we now consider classic African American texts were being brought back into print in the 1970s, but their life in print was erratic and unpredictable, and there was almost nowhere to go for critical commentary. It was an exciting and historic time, and I wish I had taken better notes to preserve for posterity everything that was happening.",

It was just insane to me that all of us have given authority to others to produce the things that we need. The things that are basic for survival should be the most essential to our labor. We as communities should be able to develop as much of those things as we need, and food is one of them. We can produce food in our communities. We can also establish the basis for creating wealth in our communities by using the resources we already have, and like I said, wealth goes beyond the idea of financial wealth. It’s people having jobs and careers in their neighborhoods, where they’re growing food and making products that are being sold within the community at neighborhood-appropriate prices, and outside the community at market-rate prices. It just makes sense to me. I am still very much involved in how we create wealth that benefits communities instead of individuals directly.\n\nI think this can be the most viable of all the things I’ve attempted to do or have done.

I have to be creative in other ways, like about how money is used or generated, or how resourceful we are when we farm land. All of that stuff is creative, too. Project EATS is a work of art that supports people’s own ability to make change. Change is hard, and most of us are not supported through change. How do we create art that actually has a direct impact on conditions that are social, economic, environmental, human, and historical? \n\nWe’ve gotten so restricted in what we define as art. It’s locational, it’s a particular form. I would say this, the only thing that we humans have even come close to creating that generates wealth, that benefits communities, is art. That’s the wealth of experience, of knowledge, of communication. It’s this kind of communication of knowledge, experience, and learning that is the ultimate definition of art, and anything that does that to me is art. Anything that benefits our communities is art.

In Méwilo, the goal is to learn about the history of the island by investigating different areas, solving puzzles, and interrogating people who live there. The following year, in 1988, the same year Super Mario Bros. 2 was released, Muriel released her second game, Freedom, a game about slaves fighting their masters. Phil Salvador of The Obscurity said it best when he states: “Freedom still shocks today, and that it debuted the same year as Super Mario Bros. 2 is almost unfathomable in the traditional framework of game history and culture.”",

      "content": "It felt like if you were to just walk out of this door and just see a new world, a new universe with so many opportunities in it. You know so many things to discover and so many vistas to look upon. It was so perfect for me. And I never felt locked in. I said what a freedom, and to have it without all of these boundaries and restrictions. Not that it was wild and undisciplined, because that was something we’d talk about. He said, ‘If my music ever became such that I’m playing without thought or without concentration, I’m finished.’ He said, ‘I’d never want to play’.\n\nTo know where you are. Because even on the Transfiguration record, as I told you, it was like a communication going on with John’s spirit. You could hear it. You could hear the response and you could hear the reply, when it would come from the bass player or from [the drummer] Roy Haynes. That was good for me, because in performance you can’t be the observer and the one who’s outputting. But to listen to how everyone was so connected, so attuned and so responsive, THAT showed precisely what he was saying. You have to be disciplined, you have to be concentrated. You can’t just say, ‘Oh I’m playing for me and as I’ll do as I please’. Otherwise it would break down, like chaos.\n\nSome people didn’t like the addition of strings. They said, ‘We know that the original recording didn’t have any strings, so why didn’t you leave it as it was?’ And finally I made a reply because they don’t know what we were talking about, about music or architecture or biology, you name it. They don’t know when or where… They don’t know what happened or transpired between myself and John. So when they would give an opinion I just replied, ‘Were you there? Did you hear his commentary and what he had to say? Are you aware of it?’ So it just became something that I consider didn’t require an answer.\n\nWe had a conversation about that piece and about every detail. We had a long talk about it and we were talking about the dimension of things, and he was showing me how the piece could even include other sounds, blends, tonalities and other resonances such as strings. So that’s how it happened, and I’ll tell you it teaches living space, and we had a very lengthy and wonderful talk about it. He talked about cosmic sounds, higher dimensions, astral levels and other worlds and realms of music and sound that I could feel.\n\nHe said, ‘I like the sound of it’. If at home and it was by an open window, the breeze coming in would cause the strings to sound and he could hear the wind playing through the strings. He liked it! The harp has to be played with the fingers plucking the strings, but it uses air and that’s what I liked so much about it.\n\nNo. I think it’s even closer, because with a piano the notes meet with a mallet inside and that meets with a string but it doesn’t breathe. It’s such a wonderful instrument. With the harp, maybe that’s why we think of heavenly things and divine things, because we get that rush of the wind.\n\nWell some of the outstanding things that I learned was that in life we make appointments. And when we make an appointment there’s desire connected with it, and that desires create the possibility of disappointment, frustration and all kinds of negative responses when they’re not fulfilled. So he says, ‘Go back to the root of the whole situation, don’t attach yourself to an idea so strong that you make an appointment, because if you make an appointment you can get ready to be disappointed. But say, if you want to build a ship, build it in a detached manner. Don’t build it subjectively, don’t build it by putting your full faith into a technical, temporary, mundane, or materialistic thing. Go about it in a detached way. Detached doesn’t mean disliked, it just means that I don’t want this project to consume me. It will if I allow it. If I subject myself it ends up binding and controlling me. I can’t sleep at night because that’s all I’m concerned about. So I will go and do my work objectively.’ That’s one of the best lessons I’ve learned that he taught us.\n\nThat was just a special evening. Even the people, all the elements, everything was in place somehow. The music, the musicians, just the atmosphere. It was so interesting because, to me, even at some levels it was higher than a concert audience. It was like a gathering of people who give something that we also receive. And we also give to their receptivity, what they’re there for. So it was like that sharing, that giving, that just kept reverberating and encompassing the whole evening. That’s when I started to see that audiences do become a part of the music in their own way. I think you become aware of where their heart and their spirit is, because it’s coming towards you. What you’re doing is just like as if that’s what they’re doing. They’re breathing it with you, they’re living it through with you, they’re receiving what you experience or perceive, but also they give. They give inspiration, and then you find out you’re not just playing a solo, you’re not playing for yourself, it’s for everybody. When we talked earlier about John’s idea; it’s for all people for all the time, for the universe itself, for God. It wasn’t just for the 500 people present in that auditorium. Some of them will have something like a spiritual experience, sometimes people put themselves very deeply into sound. So deep into it that they give up everything. It’s like they renounce everything at that moment just to live those moments of music, and that I’ve seen several times.",

      "content": "How can continuity (which is \"desirable\") be practiced in  this incessant turnover? How can the stabilizing action of former classicisms be replaced? And with 'what?  \n\nAt first our only recourse in the matter seemed to be the positivity of scientific method. This, for example, was the  method adopted for the defense and promotion of languages, corresponding to the ambition of linguistics to set  itself up as a science. A profitable pretense: despite its failure  to be confirmed, it provided the basis for a system and gathered together its scattered materials. But science had ceased  having any desire to obtain this sort of guarantee, having,  meanwhile, ventured not outside the positive but beyond  positivism. It had come face to face with the baroque and understood that the work of the latter deserved cognizance.  \n\nThe most recent developments of science invite us, therefore, to venture in our quest beyond the laws laid down by its  philosophies. For a long time we have divined both order  and disorder in the world and projected these as measure  and excess. But every poetics led us to believe something  that, of course, is not wrong: that excessiveness of order and  a measured disorder exist as weIl. The only discernible stabilities in Relation have to do with the interdependence of the  cycles operative there, how their corresponding patterns of movement are in tune. In Relation analytic thought is led to construct unities whose interdependent variances jointly piece together the interactive totality. These unities are not  models but revealing echos-monde. Thought makes music.   \n\nWilliam Faulkner's work, Bob Marley's song, the theories of  Benoit Mandelbrot, are aIl échos-monde. Wilfredo Lam's paint- ing (flowing together) or that of Roberto Matta (tearing  apart); the architecture of Chicago and just as easily the  shantytowns of Rio or Caracas; Ezra Pound's Cantos but also  the marching of schoolchildren in Soweto are échos-monde.",

      "content": "I like thinking and writing about Black scientists, and I’m particularly interested in George Washington Carver, who, for nearly fifty years, was a professor at the Tuskegee Institute, an important, historically Black institution. The thing I’ve found interesting about accounts of his life is that he pottered around and tinkered. He became famous in the US for agricultural innovation and for coming up with inventive uses for peanuts. But it’s clear through studying the research about him that he thought of the laboratory as an artist’s studio. He was in there pottering and pondering. I am quite interested in how scientific creativity in the laboratory, in contemporary theoretical math and physics and these sorts of things, may have a similar ontology to art making. Art and science occupy different sites in a sociological sense, but they are in some ways parallel planes of creativity.\nI have long known and admired the work of Kerry James Marshall. The moment I found out that a lay love of science had informed the way he conceptualized his art, other interesting things began to emerge from his work for me: the angles; the choice of using a kind of obsidian black, the blackest black color choice, the color that contains all others in the spectrum. That makes Marshall’s work multidimensional in a new way. Although as a child I felt trapped in the sciences as a career trajectory, there was a part of me that had a deep appreciation for what science can accomplish in the world at its best, and later in life, at its worst. So my definition of science wouldn’t be satisfactory to all scientists because I see its parallels with artistry (or “mastry,” to use the name of Marshall’s exhibition at the Met), and also because I have a critical relationship to it. But I know many scientists who understand their work to be a creative endeavor, not so different from what it is to be an artist or a writer, or from other work that requires you to go into a solitary concentration on one thing for a long period of time.\nI think it’s intrinsic. I think that is the beauty and burden of one’s particular standpoint. I don’t know how to do it any other way. I don’t know how to write a work that doesn’t take into consideration the experiences of people who look like me, who are like me. But also, in regard to spaces of science and technology, I think we learn more and more deeply about their social implications, about their implications for ethics and social justice, when we take the standpoint of people, of communities like those of African Americans, that have been the most damaged by science and technology, and in some cases that have been the most innovative with it, despite these countervailing forces. I say this a lot in my public lectures, because even after completing this research, my mind is still blown by this.\nIn my research on direct-to-consumer genetic ancestry testing, African American senior citizens were the early adopters of this new start-up technology. And that’s not how we think today about direct-to-consumer ancestry testing. We think about 23andMe and the “quantified self.” What does it mean? I want to explore the grace and courage that it takes to be a community of sixty-, seventy-year-old African Americans who grew up under Jim Crow, who grew up under very explicit conversations about scientific racism, and about whether or not Black people had what it took to be leaders in science and technology and, God forbid, even to understand it. I want to try and convey the profundity of that. These are people who had that lived experience and understood very well the stakes of engaging with genetic science. A lot of the folks I write about and encountered early in that project, whom I interviewed and spent time with, are upper-middle-class professionals. So many of them have had careers that are in the sciences or parallel to the sciences and technology, often in the federal or municipal governments. They really appreciate how important it is for them to have a particular role in giving shape to what various forms of technoscience can mean in their lives. And I think that if we want to understand anything about science and technology, we need to begin with the people who have been the most damaged, the most subjugated by it, but who also, out of that history, are often able to be early adopters and innovators. That’s incredible.\nIt’s funny. My mother, just before I was born, so in the mid-to-late ’60s, worked for the US Army. I don’t know if women were officially in the army then, so it might have been the WAVES program1 or some other gender-segregated faction of the military. But she was a cryptographer in the army, and by the time I was in kindergarten or first grade, my mother was working on big IBM mainframe computers for the US Department of Defense. Some of my earliest memories were of being picked up after school and my mom taking us to volleyball practice or a Camp Fire Girls event or whatever, being in the back of a station wagon filled with computing paraphernalia like punch cards and cathode-ray tubes. And early programming required handwritten algorithms—you used flowchart templates to create the squares and arrows and lines that graphically represented a process or algorithm. Because those are my foundational years, there’s no opposition for me between technology and my Black experience. It’s actually in some ways the seedbed of my experience. I have this biographical foundation that then gets taken up in a critical exercise by the time I’m in graduate school. I understand that personal history and a lot of my desire to write in the spaces that I do is connected to my time as a graduate student. I was an obsessive writer and reader in the mid-1990s, at a time when there was a critical mass of really great scholarship and nonfiction work being published that helps us to begin to understand the history of science, race, and racism.\n\nThat’s exactly right: it is this parallel world. There was an exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem called The Shadows Took Shape, and for one of the catalog essays, I reflected on Black women poets from the nineteenth century and early writers who were trying to think about cosmology and early instantiations of science and technology, to pull that timeline even further back. Mark Dery did a series of interviews in 1994 [for his book Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture], and in the introduction to those interviews, he coined the term Afrofuturism to capture epistemologies and ontologies in African American and Black diaspora life. He gives name to a tradition that’s hundreds of years old. In the US and in North America—more in the US, I think—we talk increasingly about slavery as the original sin, but we want to also talk about racial slavery, chattel slavery as originary in another way. For the book, Dery interviewed the historian and cultural theorist Tricia Rose, who wrote the first monograph on hip-hop culture, called Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in America, which for me is a very important book about race and technology that doesn’t get read that way. Dery poses a question to Rose about race and technology.\nTo paraphrase Tricia’s words: Black people are the first robots. We are the first service instruments, service tools that are like robots, deemed to be both human and not-human. The contemporary literature on robots is instructive: for them to be effective and useful (to humans), they have to be humanoid enough; we like when they have eyes and maybe the eyebrows go up and down, but they can’t be too human. I think that’s one summation of racial slavery and the Black experience. John Harley Warner, a historian of science at Yale, and Steven Epstein, who’s a sociologist of science at Northwestern, write about this change over time, from the nineteenth-century “principle of specificity,” in which medical diagnoses were said to differ by age, race, gender, climate, and other variables, to a kind of medical universalism in which medical therapies were said to be effective across and despite these variables.\nBut as Dorothy Roberts, the civil rights sociologist and law professor, reminds us, the idea of biological racial differences in medicine exists in the present. Think about a figure like J. Marion Sims, the “father of modern gynecology,” who we know did his experiments on Black women without anesthesia.2 This is a moment—the nineteenth century—in the medical literature and in the scientific racism literature in which all of these arguments are being made about the literal biological differences of Black people, whether or not we are people, and if we are people, how different we are from people who are not Black. Steven Epstein calls it the “inclusion-and-difference paradigm”3 in the contemporary moment. But we’re supposed to be so different, African Americans, and yet we’re similar enough, or moreover the same biologically, such that you can do gynecological experiments or medical research or organ harvesting on us and use that research on other people. Even in science and medicine and technology, there’s a split mind about difference and similarity. To go back to the robot analogy, that is an originary moment for Blackness and technology that makes the relationship between the two distinctive.\nI don’t know how to live without doing research.\n\nOf course, it’s not linear! We have made it linear in all sorts of ways. Yes, we’ve got our Roman calendar. But we’re always lurching forward and falling back. We live that and we understand that in our experience, even as we know that our bodies decay and decline over time. We grow old in a linear fashion. We see children grow before us in a way that is very linear, but we also know that there is a kernel or core of an adult person that is who they were as children. There’s this looping back and forward that is very much part of human experience. There is psychic comfort in linearity; it makes us feel like we’ve harnessed the world, that we’ve got control over the world. Linearity makes it possible for one to get caught up in a sense of inevitable social, political progress. In the moment we are living in now, I think part of the trauma of living under the raw racism, misogyny, and xenophobia of the Trump era derives from feelings of stalled progress and doused expectations. From an over-investment in a progress narrative—particularly with regards to racial politics, issues of gender equality and equity—without sufficient attention to the fact that there’s the falling backward as much as there are leaps forward, and understanding that that is an inevitable part of the social dynamic. The great mythos of American life is the idea that we’re always improving, always moving forward. And the great story of science and technology is that it is also always leaping forward to good ends. To my mind, this political moment should be one of humility, of paying attention to looping back, and of acknowledging that sometimes looping back means failure, means going back to the woodshed, means throwing out what we thought we knew and thinking again.",

Forty acres and two mules were promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave labor and mass murder of Black people. We will accept the payment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities. The Germans are now aiding the Jews in Israel for the genocide of the Jewish people.

We will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like Black people, are being victimized by the White racist government of America. We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police and the racist military by whatever means necessary.\n\n7) We Want An Immediate End to Police Brutality and the Murder of Black People.\n\nWe believe we can end police brutality in our Black community by organizing Black self-defense groups that are dedicated to defending our Black community from racist police oppression and brutality. The Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States gives a right to bear arms. We therefore believe that all Black people should arm themselves for self-defense.\n\n8) We Want Freedom For All Black Men Held in Federal, State, County and City Prisons and Jails.\n\nWe believe that all Black People should be released from the many jails and prisons because they have not received a fair and impartial trial.\n\n9) We Want All Black People When Brought to Trial To Be Tried In Court By A Jury Of Their Peer Group Or People From Their Black Communities, As Defined By the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe believe that the courts should follow the United States Constitution so that Black people will receive fair trials. The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives a man a right to be tried by his peer group. A peer is a person from a similar economic, social, religious, geographical, environmental, historical, and racial background. To do this the court will be forced to select a jury from the Black community from which the Black defendant came. We have been, and we are being, tried by all-White juries that have no understanding of the “average reasoning man” of the Black community.\n\n10) We Want Land, Bread, Housing, Education, Clothing, Justice And Peace.\n\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect of the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.",

      "content": "Concrete Experience as a Criterion of Meaning. My aunt used to say, ‘A heap see, but a few know,\"’ remembers Carolyn Chase, a 31-year-old inner city Black woman. This saying depicts two types of knowing - knowledge and wisdom - and taps the first dimension of an Afrocentric feminist epistemology. Living life as Black women requires wisdom because knowledge about the dynamics of race, gender, and class oppression has been essential to Black women’s survival. African-American women give such wisdom high credence in assessing knowledge.\n\nAllusions to these two types of knowing pervade the words of a range of African-American women. Zilpha Elaw, a preacher of the mid 1800s, explains the tenacity of racism: \"The pride of a white skin is a bauble of great value with many in some parts of the United States, who readily sacrifice their intelligence to their prejudices, and possess more knowledge than wisdom.\" In describing differences separating African-American and white women, Nancy White invokes a similar rule: \"When you come right down to it, white women just think they are free. Black women know they ain’t free.\" Geneva Smitherman, a college professor specializing in African-American linguistics, suggests that \"from a black perspective, written documents are limited in what they can teach about life and survival in the world. Blacks are quick to ridicule ‘educated fools,’ . . . they have ‘book learning’ but no ‘mother wit,’ knowledge, but not wisdom.\" Mabel Lincoln eloquently summarizes the distinction between knowledge and wisdom: \"To black people like me, a fool is funny-you know, people who love to break bad, people you can’t tell anything to, folks that would take a shotgun to a roach.\"\n\nAfrican-American women need wisdom to know how to deal with the \"educated fools\" who would \"take a shotgun to a roach.\" As members of a subordinate group, Black women cannot afford to be fools of any type, for our objectification as the other denies us the protections that white skin, maleness, and wealth confer. This distinction between knowledge and wisdom, and the use of experience as the cutting edge dividing them, has been key to Black women’s survival. In the context of race, gender, and class oppression, the distinction is essential. Knowledge without wisdom is adequate for the powerful, but wisdom is essential to the survival of the subordinate....\n\nExperience, as a criterion of meaning with practical images as its symbolic vehicles is a fundamental epistemological tenet in African-American thought systems. \"Look at my arm!\" Sojoumer Truth proclaimed\" I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain’t I a woman. By invoking concrete practical images from her own life to symbolize new meanings, Truth deconstructed the prevailing notions of woman. Stories, narratives, and Bible principles are selected for their applicability to the lived experiences of African-Americans and become symbolic representations of a whole wealth of experience, Bible tales are often told for the wisdom they express about everyday life, so their interpretation involves no need for scientific historical verification. The narrative method requires that the story be told, not torn apart in analysis, and trusted as core belief, not \"admired as science.\" . . .\n\nSome feminist scholars offer a similar claim that women as a group are more likely than men to use concrete knowledge in assessing knowledge claims. For example, a substantial number of the 135 women in a study of women’s cognitive development were \"connected knowers\" and were drawn to the sort of knowledge that emerges from first-hand observation. Such women felt that because knowledge comes from experience, the best way of understanding another person’s ideas was to develop empathy and share the experiences that led the person to form those ideas.\n\nIn valuing the concrete, African-American women invoke not only an Afrocentric tradition but a women’s tradition as well. Some feminist theorists suggest that women are socialized in complex relational nexuses where context rules versus abstract principles govern behavior. This socialization process is thought to stimulate characteristic ways of knowing. These theorists suggest that women are more likely to experience two modes of knowing: one located in the body and the space it occupies and the other passing beyond it. Through their child-rearing and nurturing activities, women mediate these two modes and use the concrete experiences of their daily lives to assess more abstract knowledge claims.\n\nAlthough- valuing the concrete may be more representative of women than men, social class differences among women may generate differential expression of this women’s value. One study of working-class women’s ways of knowing found that both white and African-American women rely on common sense and intuition. These forms of knowledge allow for subjectivity between the knower and the known, rest in the women themselves (not in higher authorities), and are experienced directly in the world (not through abstractions)....\n\nIn traditional African-American communities Black women find considerable institutional support for valuing concrete experience. Black women’s centrality in families, churches, and other community organizations allows us to share our concrete knowledge of what it takes to be self defined. Black women with younger, less experienced sisters. \"Sisterhood is not new to Black women,\" asserts Bonnie Thornton Dill, but \"while Black women have fostered and encouraged sisterhood, we have not used it as the anvil to forge our political identities.\" Though not expressed in explicitly political terms, this relationship of sisterhood among Black women can be seen as a model for a whole series of relationships African-American women have with one another.\n\n. Given that Black churches and families are both woman-centered, Afrocentric institutions, African-American women traditionally have found considerable institutional support for this dimension of an Afrocentric feminist epistemology. While white women may value the concrete, it is questionable whether white families -particularly middle-class nuclear ones-and white community institutions provide comparable types of support. Similarly, while Black men are supported by Afrocentric institutions, they cannot participate in Black women’s sisterhood. In terms of Black women’s relationships with one another, African-American women may find it easier than others to recognize connectedness as a primary way of knowing, simply because we are encouraged to do so by a Black women’s tradition of sisterhood.",

      "content": "The undersigned, being alternately pissed off and bored, need a means of speculation and asserting a different set of values with which to re-imagine the future. In looking for a new framework for black diasporic artistic production, we are temporarily united in the following actions. ***The Mundane Afrofuturists recognize that***.   We did not originate in the cosmos. The connection between Middle Passage and space travel is tenuous at best. Out of five hundred thirty-four space travelers, fourteen have been black. An all-black crew is unlikely. Magic interstellar travel and/or the wondrous communication grid can lead to an illusion of outer space and cyberspace as egalitarian. This dream of utopia can encourage us to forget that outer space will not save us from injustice and that cyberspace was prefigured upon a “master/slave” relationship. While we are often Othered, we are not aliens. Though our ancestors were mutilated, we are not mutants. Post-black is a misnomer. Post-colonialism is too. The most likely future is one in which we only have ourselves and this planet. ***The Mundane Afrofuturists rejoice in***.   Piling up unexamined and hackneyed tropes, and setting them alight. Gazing upon their bonfire of the Stupidities, which includes, but is not exclusively limited to: Jive-talking aliens; Jive-talking mutants; Magical negroes; Enormous self-control in light of great suffering; Great suffering as our natural state of existence; Inexplicable skill in the martial arts; Reference to Wu Tang; Reference to Sun Ra; Reference to Parliament Funkadelic and/or George Clinton; Reference to Janelle Monáe; Obvious, heavy-handed allusions to double-consciousness; Desexualized protagonists; White slavery; Egyptian mythology and iconography; The inner city; Metallic colors; Sassiness; Platform shoes; Continue at will… ***We also recognize***.   The harmless fun that these and all the other Stupidities have brought to millions of people. The harmless fun that burning the Stupidities will bring to millions of people. The imaginative challenge that awaits any Mundane Afrofuturist author who accepts that this is it: Earth is all we have. What will we do with it? The chastening but hopefully enlivening effect of imagining a world without fantasy bolt-holes: no portals to the Egyptian kingdoms, no deep dives to Drexciya, no flying Africans to whisk us off to the Promised Land. The possibilities of a new focus on black humanity: our science, technology, culture, politics, religions, individuality, needs, dreams, hopes, and failings. The surge of bedazzlement and wonder that awaits us as we contemplate our own cosmology of blackness and our possible futures. The relief of recognizing our authority. We will root our narratives in a critique of normative, white validation. Since “fact” and “science” have been used throughout history to serve white supremacy, we will focus on an emotionally true, vernacular reality. The understanding that our “twoness” is inherently contemporary, even futuristic. DuBois asks how it feels to be a problem. Ol’ Dirty Bastard says “If I got a problem, a problem’s got a problem ’til it’s gone.” An awakening sense of the awesome power of the black imagination: to protect, to create, to destroy, to propel ourselves towards what poet Elizabeth Alexander describes as “a metaphysical space beyond the black public everyday toward power and wild imagination.” The opportunity to make sense of the nonsense that regularly—and sometimes violently—accents black life. The electric feeling that Mundane Afrofuturism is the ultimate laboratory for world building outside of imperialist, capitalist, white patriarchy. The sense that the rituals and inconsistencies of daily life are compelling, dynamic, and utterly strange. Mundane Afrofuturism opens a number of themes and flavors to intertextuality, double entendre, politics, incongruity, polyphony, and collective first-person—techniques that we have used for years to make meaning. ***The Mundane Afrofuturists promise:***   To produce a collection of Mundane Afrofuturist literature that follows these rules: 1) No interstellar travel—travel is limited to within the solar system and is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. 2) No inexplicable end to racism— dismantling white supremacy would be complex, violent, and have global impact. 3) No aliens unless the connection is distant, difficult, tenuous, and expensive—and they have no interstellar travel either. 4) No internment camps for blacks, aliens, or black aliens 5) No Martians, Venusians, etc. 6) No forgetting about political, racial, social, economic, and geographic struggles. 7) No alternative universes. 8) No revisionist history. 9) No magic or supernatural elements. 10) No Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, or Bucks. 12) No time travel or teleportation. 13) No Mammies, Jezebels, or Sapphires. 14) Not to let Mundane Afrofuturism cramp their style, as if it could. 15) To burn this manifesto as soon as it gets boring. 16) Martine Syms & whomever will join me in the future of black imagination.",

      "content": "This piece is meant to set “methodological direction” for a racially gendered  horror discourse. For we insist that—in the parlance of Mae G. Henderson’s work in   Black cultural studies—we are both supplementing the perceived “lack” of Black  women’s horror discourse while simultaneously displacing its perceived “absence.” It is  necessary to note that we are not setting an oppositional discourse, but rather are  choosing to shift and redefine boundaries by articulating a discourse that is centered on sankofarration, incorporating a biorhetoric framework that renders Black women as  constantly oscillating sites of rupture, and finally, the potentiality in the act of haunting as  resistance.  \n  \nSankofarration, a conflation of Sankofa and narration, is a cosmological episteme  that centers the act of claiming the future as well as the past.6 Sankofa eschews  contemporary Westernity’s assertion of the linearity of time and there is an intentional  conflation of the past, the present, and the future. Sankofarration insists that the past is  just as important and necessary to a healthy and whole progress towards the future. Within Sankofarration time is cyclical: “Metaphysically, being was equivalent to  duration: each moment embodied a recurrence of a past moment, and implied was a  potential future recurrence...[t]ime included, or perhaps “belonged to,” the communitity  as a whole.” Grounding Black women’s horror discourse in sankofarration effectively  cleaves horror from the trauma of enslavement and moves the concept of horror towards  a more creative and artistic construction. The privileging of sankofarration does not  exclude enslavement as a topic for creative horror exploration it simply rejects the idea of  enslavement as the primogenitor of Black horror. This action separates the horrific acts  associated with chattel slavery (natural horror) and pushes the discourse closer to what  Noël Carroll conceives of as “art-horror” but within a specifically Black feminist  framework. Sankofarration clears a space to codify a Black women’s horror discourse  for it is by collapsing the fallacious linearity of time and reconnecting to preColonial  West Africa that we can move from the problematic construction of The Middle Passage  and the subsequent enslavement of African diasporic peoples as the point of origin for  Black horror studies as a whole and a Black women’s horror discourse in particular.  \n\nBiorhetorics combines “biology” and “rhetoric” as lexical terminology, academic  discourse and theory of practical application. Stephen Pain asserts, “Biorhetorics is an  applied form of rhetoric for actual usage in the life sciences” (755). Kristie Fleckenstein,  on the other hand, argues that biorhetorics is “a discourse of bodysigns” (761). For  Fleckenstein, biorhetorics “offers the possibility of effecting change by positioning us  within the ambiguous interplay of materiality and semiosis” (761). Using biorhetorics as  a framework to explicate Black women’s bodies provides some insight to the potentiality  of this work and crossroad. Using the body, being careful to include all its differences  genetically and superficially, as a rhetorical tool allows us to deconstruct language that is  “mutually entangled in a nonlinear weave of cause and effect. We can know them [body,  language, and sign(s)] and live them only at a point where they blur” (Fleckenstein 762).  Black women’s body and the discourse of horror are physically and inherently linked  regardless if it is verbally expounded. \n  \nExploring the potentiality of biorhetorics allows us to open another avenue of  discussion for Black women horror discourse. We see Black women bodies as a  disruption in normative writing, thinking, and being by way of being in a biological and  rhetorical sense. Understanding that biological ruptures create disjunctures in time and  space allows the possibility of multi-leveled configurations within already dynamic and  different bodies—physical bodies and bodies of works. This framework enables us to  push against boundaries and resist traditional notions of Black women in horror. Kinitra  Brooks notes how she “address[es] the problem of how patriarchal and Eurocentric  notions perpetuate multiracial representations of men juxtaposed against monoracial  representations of women” when scholars critique Black women bodies work. She  continues, “I speak of this tendency as a tradition, for the problematic lack of  representation of women of color in popular Western texts has been systematically  analyzed and decried in the latter half of the twentieth century.”",

Matter of fact, the whole band played on the record, but they weren’t as intense as he was so I had to take them off. And that’s been a classic ever since.\n\nI’ve always said I really didn’t know what the fuck I was doing. That was the first time I was really turned loose in the studio. So I found out like, wow, I can pan. Well, shit, lemme pan the foot over here [laughs].\nWe did the whole album in one day, mixed it and all, on three or four tabs of yellow sunshine. Both the first and second albums we did in one day, tripping out of our minds like a motherfucker. When I heard ’em six months later, I said damn, this is sloppy. I could never let myself do that again—and after that, engineers wouldn’t allow it. They’d say naw, man, there has to be a better way. Sly told me there was an easier way to do a tape loop, which is to do it on two track and then bounce it back.\nPreachers, pimps, and politicians.\n\nThe boy has got energy up the asshole. I mean, he don’t just stand there, he don’t just make it, he mashes. I was talking to him and said, “Hey James, give me 17 splits.” The boy gave me 18 faster than a motherfucker. And hard, too, like bam, bam, bam! My nuts go crazy just thinking about a mug doing that many. But, oh yeah, P-Funk is beyond commercialism now.\nWe got off in Minnesota, and there was nothing but white people ate the gig. See, that’s what’s weird now—a lot of white people come to the shows. And all they want to hear is Let’s Take It to the Stage, Maggot Brain, Standing on the Verge.\nOne girl came in one night with 51 albums. I didn’t know I’d been on that many records. And she came in there talking about, would you please sign these for me. I said, baby, I really appreciate you got all these records, but I tell you what I’m gonna do: since all the members of the group are pretty much stars, I’m going to give each one two records to sign. Well, she was elated. Little bitty white girl couldn’t be no more than 19. And that’s been the trip all around the country with white people lately. Their thang is to come up to me and say, “I got all the records P-Funk ever put out.”\nNext Funkadelic album, By Way of the Drum, has got an island vibe to it. Not reggae, but more like junkanoo and calypso. Done that one with the band and some drummers down there in Nassau.\nThen Parliament has a real interesting one coming out called Upsouth. It’s about—like, are you hip to lobotomy? They tried to legalize it about four or five years ago as a treatment for so-called violent criminals. There’s a place out in California called Vacaville Medical Correctional facility. You dig, that’s where they’re gonna correct you medically. And now they can do it with a laser beam. They don’t even have to open up your head any more.\nSo the album is about up south, where a dude dies of a headache because he vows never to pick another lick of cotton out of a pill bottle. See, it’s about funny farming, hoeing in concrete, and the Vacaville Thrill, where they drill into your will, cut into your consciousness, and dissect your dreams. Because that’s what they’re all about now. The Hinckleys and all those that go out and shoot people—they’re not just nuts. They are the product of somebody pushing buttons.\nAt a certain point you have to change before you reach the point of saturation.\nThat’s why when we finished the Mothership tour we said, now let’s go on the anti tour immediately. Soon as we had finished four years of all that glitter we said let’s go to all these little bitty places and play three hours for us.\nNo limousines, get to the gig the best way you can, and just get your ass out there and jam. Or else you’ll start believing that star shit. And when a motherfucker says you ain’t shit, you will die of a heart attack. Especially after you have psyched yourself up to believe you are the equal of 30 million albums. Right now I say fuck a limousine. I’ll take a cab in a minute. I walked to see Thomas Dolby. And that gives you strength.\nBecause people ask, man, ain’t you tired, and I say I don’t fee like I’ve done shit. I rehearsed for this 17 years of my life. When I was younger I used to walk down side streets in Newark on Sunday when the stores were closed, screaming “Parliament, Parliament!”—just so I could hear what it was going to be like when I made it to where I wanted to be. So if I’m crazy now, I was crazy then.\nYou looking for the serious supergroup? We got it right here. We have magic, man. This is a very gifted group, and when we come together, it is about magic! In the next few months, things are gonna tighten up even more for us. Just doing the R&B circuit is cool, but this is a crossover group. We got individuals here whose heads are someplace else. But if and when we reconnect, your whole body will feel it. Your hair will stand up. I don’t care if your hair is nappy, that shit’ll straighten up and then curl back.\n\nWe’ve got more to give than the ear might be able to understand. On nights when it’s really happening, you can hear a new vernacular. Even on bullshit nights you can hear the magic. If I was just a spectator I’d be saying, “Yeah this is the muthafucka!”\n\nThis is an eternal group with most definitely some eternal secrets. Stuff you don’t even talk about, almost like being in a lodge. We have a couple of Masons in the group, and they got steel hips, and we kind of lock their shit up in there. I’m not trying to be evasive, but you know the P-Funk hand sign? Well, see, it’s not about the sign, really. It’s not about any sign. It’s about what people give. Spiritually, you deal with the music, because that’s coming from the soul, and that’s whites’ happening. “Cosmic Slop” is very spiritual because that’s like the root we come from. The blues in my playing comes from my grandmother; she taught me how to play. She bought me one of those motel Mickey Mouse guitars, the kind you wind up. And I sat down and looked at it one time and said, fuck this, because I was tired of winding up and hearing the same melody. I said, “Give me some music.” So she started showing me some things, and she saw that I was into it.\n\nYou hear some of my chords as haunting?. I’m going to tell you something: we have been going through a haunting era. Check out what we’re going through now! I really don’t want to get into that, but see, it makes you hear something else, and you have to play those feelings. I’m into the earth. Yeah, we can go to space, but so what? It’s all about making people move, making people feel happy. Calm ’em down, make ’em think about themselves, too. Music can do all that. Music can make you shit.\n\nI like to lay back and color in.\n\nThe Mothership was my favorite show, Can’t nothing top that. And I think whenever George puts together the return of Mothership, that’s when you’ll see us all come back together a lot tighter. Because that one was really about enlarging the mind. Inner and outer space.\n\nGeorge basically writes all the lyrics and helps us arrange it. He doesn’t play an instrument; he plays ears. He can hum it to you, but other than that he don’t play no instrument. He’s the overseer, the man with the concept. Bernie is the super ears, mixing classical with funk, and really making it spiritual. The next Funkadelic album, By Way of the Drum, mixes African, Brazilian, and Bata drumming with electronics. We need a new direction, and that’s where music is going anyway.\nEverything you hear now is drums. Most dominant thing on a record now is drums. The drums give us something to follow. The drums are talking to us now, like they were talking to us in the beginning.\nThere’s so many of us that it’s hard to blow a concept. Everybody loves to contribute, because we live and breathe what we do. We could’ve gone into rock. We thought about it. But now the world has come to accept funk. Before that, funk was a bad word. Now everybody sees funk is working, and so the average mug now is funky. Eats chitlins and lots of beans so he’s full of gas. Funk is a way of life.\nYou can’t leave the funk once you get into this, because this is addictive. We’re still one big happy family, that’s why we’re still making music together. I believe I was born funky. I always knew I was going to be here with George. That’s why I’m here to make more funk, then past on to the babies when I get too old and can’t funk no more.",

      "content": "Black culture highlights the observance of such repetition, often in homage to an original generative instance or act. Cosmogony, the origins and stability of things, hence prevails because it recurs, not because the world continues to develop from the archetypal moment. Periodic ceremonies are ways that black culture comes to terms with its perception of repetition, precisely by highlighting that perception. Dance often accompanies those ritualistic occasions when a seasonal return is celebrated and the \"rounds\" of the dance (as of the \"Ring Shout\" or \"Circle Dance\") recapitulate the \"roundings\" of natural time: Christmas, New Year's, funerals, harvest-time.  \n\nThe discourse used of capital in European economic parlance reveals a more general insight about the manner in which this culture differs from black culture in its handling of repetition. In black culture, repetition means that the thing circulates (exactly in the manner of any flow, including capital flows) there in an equilibrium. In European culture, repetition must be seen to be not just circulation and flow, but accumulation and growth. In black culture, the thing (the ritual, the dance, the beat) is \"there for you to pick it up when you come back to get it.\" If there is a goal (Zweck) in such a culture, it is always deferred; it continually \"cuts\" back to the start, in the musical meaning of \"cut\" as an abrupt, seemingly unmotivated break (an accidental da capo) with a series already in progress and a willed return to a prior series.  \n\nA culture based on the idea of the \"cut\" will always suffer in a society whose dominant idea is material progress but \"cuts\" possess their charm! In European culture, the \"goal\" is always clear: that which always is being worked towards. The goal is thus that which is reached only when culture \"plays out\" its history. Such a culture is never \"immediate,\" but \"mediated\" and separated from the present tense by its own future-orientation. Moreover, European culture does not allow \"a succession of accidents and surprises,\" but instead maintains the illusions of progression and control at all costs. Black culture, in the \"cut,\" builds \"accidents\" into its coverage, almost as if to control their unpredictability. Itself a kind of cultural coverage, this magic of the \"cut\" attempts to confront accident and rupture not by covering them over, but by making room for them inside the system itself.  \n\nRepetition in black culture finds its most characteristic shape in performance: rhythm in music and dance and language.25 Whether or not one upholds poet-politician- philosopher Leopold Senghor's attempts to fix the nature of black culture in a concept of negritude (I do not), it is true that he has well described the role that rhythm plays in it: \"The organizing force which makes the black style is rhythm. It is the most perceptible and least material thing .... \"26 Where material is absent, dialectics is groundless. Repetitive words and rhythms have long been recognized as a focal constituent of African music and its American descendants-slave-songs, blues, spirituals, and jazz.27 African music normally emphasizes dynamic rhythm, organizing melody within juxtaposed lines of beats grouped into differing meters. The fact that repetition in some sense is the principle of organization shows the desire to rely upon \"the thing that is there to pick up.\" Progress in the sense of \"avoidance of repetition\" would at once sabotage such an effort. Without an organizing principle of repetition, true improvisation would be impossible, as an improvisator relies upon the ongoing recurrence of the beat. \n\nNot only improvisation, but also the characteristic \"call- and-response\" element in black culture (which already, in eliciting the general participation of the group at random, spontaneous \"cuts,\" disallows any possibility of a haute culture) requires an assurance of repetition: \n\nWhile certain rhythms may establish a background beat, in almost all African music there is a dominant point of repetition developed from a dominant conversation with a clearly defined alternation, a swinging back and forth from solo to chorus or from solo to an emphatic instrumental reply. \n\nThat the beat is there to pick up does not mean that it must have been metronomic, but merely that it must have been at one point begun and that it must be at any point \"social\"- i.e., amenable to re-starting, interruption, or entry by a second or third player or to response by an additional musician. The typical polymetry of black music means that there are at least two, and usually more, rhythms going on alongside the listener's own beat. The listener's beat is a kind of Erwartungshorizont (to use a term taken from a quite different area) or \"horizon of expectations,\" whereby he or she knows where the constant beat must fall in order to properly make sense of the gaps that the other interacting drummers have let fall.29 Because one rhythm always defines another in black music, and beat is an entity of relation, any \"self-consciousness\" or \"achievement\" in the sense of an individual participant's working towards his or her own rhythmic or tonal climax \"above the mass\" would have disastrous results.",
